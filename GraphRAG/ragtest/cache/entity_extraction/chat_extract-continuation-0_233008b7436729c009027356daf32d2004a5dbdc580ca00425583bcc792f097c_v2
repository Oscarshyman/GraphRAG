The Quiescence–Senescence Continuum: A Framework for Understanding Quiescence-Origin Senescence              2.1. Direct Transition from Quiescence to Senescence        Mounting evidence in the past decade demonstrates a direct transition to senescence in quiescent cells under stress or with aging. One of the first reports of this phenomenon was in geriatric mice, where quiescent satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MuSCs) lose regenerative capacity and become irreversibly arrested [13]. The same observation was confirmed in geriatric human muscle, suggesting a conserved mechanism contributing to age-related decline in muscle regenerative capacity [13]. The quiescence-to-senescence transition in geriatric MuSCs was linked to the epigenetic derepression of p16INK4a, which is a key regulator of senescence [13].        Further research revealed that p16INK4a derepression in geriatric MuSCs was triggered by accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from failed autophagy [18]. Restoring autophagy prevents the transition to senescence in quiescent MuSCs [18]. Similarly, in quiescent human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), stress-induced ROS accumulation can elevate the p16INK4a level and drive the transition to senescence [14].         In vitro studies provide further evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence transition. Long-term quiescent human fibroblasts in culture (100–150 days) accumulate DNA damage and transit into senescence [15]. Our recent work showed that quiescent rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) with impaired lysosomal autophagy can directly enter a senescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest, β-galactosidase activity, and cellular hypertrophy [16]. These in vitro results strengthen the findings of in vivo studies by showing that cells maintained in quiescent conditions throughout the experiments eventually transitioned to senescence, bypassing cell proliferation (which can be difficult to track in vivo, e.g., throughout the entire geriatric phase). Together, these in vivo and in vitro studies provide compelling evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence transition, resulting in quiescence-origin senescence.                    2.2. Quiescence Deepening into Senescence: A Continuum Model        The observation that cells can transition from quiescence to senescence aligns with the concept that quiescence is not a uniform state but rather a spectrum of dormant depths. Specifically, deeper quiescent cells are more resistant to cell cycle re-entry, and they resume proliferation less frequently or with a longer delay than shallower quiescent cells given the same growth stimulation [8,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. Cells in deep quiescence generally exhibit decreased transcription, reduced RNA and protein levels, and increased chromatin condensation compared to cells in shallow quiescence [22,36,37,38]. Recent studies have further revealed the changes in the cellular profiles of gene expression, epigenetic modification, and metabolism that occur during the process of quiescence deepening [8,16,39,40,41]. It is important to note that deep quiescent cells, by definition, still retain the potential for cell cycle re-entry and can resume proliferation given a sufficiently strong and sustained growth stimulus, which is distinct from senescent cells.         Quiescence deepening has been observed under extended quiescence in culture or along the aging process in vivo across mammalian cell types and tissues [8,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33] as well as in yeast [34] and C. elegans [35]. Consistent with quiescence depth being a continuum, subpopulations of quiescent muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, upon tissue injury or in response to systemic factors, can move to shallower (primed or GAlert) quiescence, bearing a closer resemblance to active cells [42,43,44,45]. Further extending the cell dormancy state continuum, senescent cells also exhibit varying “depths” with different cellular characteristics [46,47,48].        Our recent work directly links quiescence deepening to senescence entry. We found that while enhancing lysosomal autophagy activity pushes REFs toward shallow quiescence, decreasing lysosomal autophagy drives REFs into progressively deeper quiescence [16]. When lysosomal autophagy is severely hampered (with chloroquine treatment, for example), deep quiescent (yet still reversible) cells transition into irreversible senescence [16]. This suggests that lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” that continuously adjusts cellular dormancy depth from shallow quiescence to deep quiescence and finally to senescence [16,41]. Furthermore, the transcriptomic profile changes during quiescence deepening in REFs resemble those of senescence entry with similar expression changes in “senescence core signature” genes [16,49]. A gene signature derived from quiescence deepening in REFs, the quiescence depth score (QDS), can correctly predict a wide array of senescent and aging cell types [16,50]. Together, these findings suggest that quiescence deepening represents a continuum transition trajectory from proliferation to senescence, which is a model increasingly recognized in the field [9,51,52,53,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>EVENT<|>Geriatric mice were used in studies to observe the transition from quiescence to senescence in muscle stem cells under stress or aging conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERIATRIC HUMAN MUSCLE<|>EVENT<|>Studies confirmed similar observations in geriatric human muscle regarding the loss of regenerative capacity in muscle stem cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>PERSON<|>P16INK4A is a key regulator of senescence linked to the quiescence-to-senescence transition in muscle stem cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENT SATELLITE CELLS<|>EVENT<|>Quiescent satellite cells are muscle stem cells that lose regenerative capacity and become irreversibly arrested in geriatric conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>EVENT<|>Accumulated reactive oxygen species are linked to the triggering of p16INK4A derepression in geriatric muscle stem cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>EVENT<|>Autophagy is a cellular process that, when failed, contributes to the transition of quiescent muscle stem cells to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS (HSPCs)<|>EVENT<|>HSPCs are human cells that can also transition to senescence under stress-induced conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONG-TERM QUIESCENT HUMAN FIBROBLASTS<|>EVENT<|>These cells accumulate DNA damage over time and can transition into a senescence state.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENT RAT EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS (REFs)<|>EVENT<|>REFs are used in studies to show the transition from quiescence to a senescence-like state due to impaired autophagy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL CYCLE ARREST<|>EVENT<|>Cell cycle arrest is a characteristic of cells that have transitioned into senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEEPENING<|>EVENT<|>Quiescence deepening is a process where cells transition from shallow to deep quiescence, affecting their ability to re-enter the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>EVENT<|>Senescent cells exhibit varying depths of dormancy and different cellular characteristics compared to quiescent cells.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>GERIATRIC HUMAN MUSCLE<|>Both studies involve the observation of muscle stem cells transitioning from quiescence to senescence under aging conditions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P16INK4A<|>QUIESCENT SATELLITE CELLS<|>P16INK4A is a key regulator that influences the transition of quiescent satellite cells to senescence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>P16INK4A<|>ROS accumulation triggers the derepression of P16INK4A, linking it to the transition of muscle stem cells<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>Failed autophagy leads to ROS accumulation, which is linked to the transition to senescence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS (HSPCs)<|>P16INK4A<|>P16INK4A levels can drive the transition to senescence in HSPCs under stress<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LONG-TERM QUIESCENT HUMAN FIBROBLASTS<|>CELL CYCLE ARREST<|>Long-term quiescent human fibroblasts accumulate damage and transition into a state of cell cycle arrest<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENT RAT EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS (REFs)<|>CELL CYCLE ARREST<|>REFs can enter a senescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEEPENING<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>Quiescence deepening is a process that leads to the transition into senescent cells<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
