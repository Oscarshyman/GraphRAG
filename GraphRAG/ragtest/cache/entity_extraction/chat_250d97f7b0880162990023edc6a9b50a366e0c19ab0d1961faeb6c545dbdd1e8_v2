A gene signature derived from quiescence deepening in REFs, the quiescence depth score (QDS), can correctly predict a wide array of senescent and aging cell types [16,50]. Together, these findings suggest that quiescence deepening represents a continuum transition trajectory from proliferation to senescence, which is a model increasingly recognized in the field [9,51,52,53,54,55].        Supporting the quiescence–senescence continuum concept, the levels of multiple widely used senescence biomarkers (e.g., SA-β-gal, LAMP1, IL8, 53BP1, p21, Lamin B1, and cell size) were found to increase gradually with the duration of cell-cycle withdrawal and cannot distinguish senescence from deep quiescence [56]. This quiescence–senescence continuum could help explain some normal physiological functions of cellular senescence [57], as some of the senescent cells identified based on biomarker intensities may instead be deep quiescent cells.                    3. Mechanisms Underlying Quiescence Deepening and Quiescence-Origin Senescence      The cellular processes underlying quiescence deepening and transition to senescence likely involve a complex interplay between various cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways. Yet, a converging theme has started to emerge from recent studies.               3.1. Trigger: The Lysosome–Autophagy Axis        The lysosome–autophagy axis has emerged as a critical driver of quiescence deepening and transition to senescence across various cell types. Autophagy involves autophagosomes engulfing cellular components and fusing with lysosomes, where lysosomal enzymes degrade the contents and recycle the macromolecules. This lysosome–autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” regulating quiescence depth in REFs with its continuously decreased activity leading to progressively deeper quiescence toward senescence [16]. It also underlies the quiescence-to-senescence transition in geriatric MuSCs [18].         In both REFs and geriatric MuSCs, ROS accumulation serves as a key effector of the impaired lysosomal autophagy function [16,18]. In REFs, ROS accumulation, without evoking p16INK4a, leads to quiescence deepening [16]; in MuSCs, ROS accumulation epigenetically derepresses the p16INK4a locus and leads to the quiescence-to-senescence transition [18]. Similarly, ROS accumulation drives the quiescence-to-senescence transition in HSPCs by elevating the p16INK4a level [14].         In neural stem cells (NSCs), the lysosome–autophagy axis, with increased protein aggregates as the main effector, plays a crucial role in quiescence deepening. Aging quiescent NSCs display lysosomal defects, increased protein aggregates, and diminished activation potential [58].         Enhancing lysosomal autophagy in various cell types, including REFs, MuSCs, and NSCs, promotes shallow quiescence away from the transition to senescence [16,18,58]. Together, the findings above highlight the lysosome–autophagy axis as a central trigger of quiescence deepening and the quiescence-to-senescence transition.                     3.2. Controller: The Rb–E2F Switch Threshold        Our earlier studies demonstrated that the Rb–E2F pathway, a pivotal regulator of the cell cycle in animals and plants [59,60,61,62,63], functions as a bistable toggle switch [64,65]. This Rb–E2F switch converts graded and transient mitogen signals into a binary (OFF/ON) activity of E2F (representing the combined E2F transcriptional activators, E2F1-3a), which underlies the all-or-none quiescence-to-proliferation transition [27,64,65]. The activation threshold of the Rb–E2F switch, “Rb–E2F switch threshold” for short, controls quiescence depth: increasing or decreasing this threshold drives cells to deeper and shallower quiescence, respectively [27,28,66]. The Rb–E2F switch threshold is defined as the minimum growth stimulus required to activate the cellular E2F level to exceed that of non-phosphorylated Rb, which binds to and inhibits E2F in quiescent cells [27,28,66]. We have shown that the Rb–E2F switch threshold can be modulated by multiple factors in the Rb–E2F pathway with varying degrees of sensitivity with those associated with G1 cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) being the most prominent [28].         The Rb–E2F switch is the first bistable switch that cells encounter during the transition from quiescence to proliferation in response to mitogens, and it connects to downstream bistable switches and checkpoints regulating S phase entry [67,68]. Given that the Rb–E2F pathway interacts with other quiescence regulatory pathways (e.g., Notch–Hes1, p53–p21, PI3K–Akt, DNA damage response, LKB1–AMPK, and microRNA) [10,27,63], we propose that the Rb–E2F switch serves as a core hub that integrates cellular signals to quantitatively determine the growth stimulation level required for the all-or-none cell cycle re-entry. In parallel, other cellular pathways impinge on the Rb–E2\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
