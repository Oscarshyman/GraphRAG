Dextran, a polysaccharide, plays a significant role in influencing this quiescent state. It affects the viscosity of the culture medium, which can alter the depth of quiescence in cells, particularly under varying flow conditions. Additionally, dextran modulates osmotic conditions, further impacting the quiescence state of cells by influencing their responsiveness to serum stimulation. Thus, dextran serves as a critical factor in the regulation of cellular quiescence, affecting both the physical properties of the culture environment and the biochemical responses of the cells.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749165263, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
