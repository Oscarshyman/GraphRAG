Specifically, shear stress resulting from fluid flow can induce a shallower quiescent state in cells. This alteration suggests a direct impact on cellular quiescence, as it makes cells more responsive to external stimuli, facilitating their reentry into the cell cycle. Overall, the relationship between shear stress and quiescence highlights the importance of mechanical forces in regulating cellular states and responses.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749165263, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 101, "prompt_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
