In this state, cells exhibit diminished responsiveness to growth signals, necessitating stronger stimuli for re-entry into the cell cycle compared to shallower forms of quiescence. Deep quiescent cells take longer to transition back into active growth phases, highlighting their prolonged dormancy. Importantly, while deep quiescence is distinct from senescence, it remains a reversible condition under physiological circumstances, allowing for potential reactivation when appropriate growth signals are provided.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749165253, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 402, "total_tokens": 516, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
