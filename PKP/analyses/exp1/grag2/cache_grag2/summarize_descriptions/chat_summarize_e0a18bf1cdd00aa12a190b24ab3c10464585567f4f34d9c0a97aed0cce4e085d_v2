This state leads to significant metabolic changes in cells, often resulting in quiescence or a deepening of quiescence. During serum starvation, cellular metabolism and function are notably affected, which in turn influences the cell cycle reentry. As a method, serum starvation is commonly employed to induce quiescence in various cell types, highlighting its importance in studies related to cellular behavior and senescence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749165253, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 341, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
