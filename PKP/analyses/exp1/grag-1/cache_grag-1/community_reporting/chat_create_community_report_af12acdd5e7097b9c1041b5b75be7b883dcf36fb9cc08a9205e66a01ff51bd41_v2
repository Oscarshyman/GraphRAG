These cells possess the unique ability to differentiate into various types of neural cells, including neurons and glial cells. They can enter different states of quiescence or activation depending on environmental cues, allowing them to maintain their undifferentiated state while also being poised for rapid reentry into the cell cycle when needed. Additionally, neural stem cells can adaptively enter a shallower quiescent state in response to injury, a characteristic they share with muscle stem cells. This dynamic capability underscores their importance in neurogenesis and the brain's response to damage.\",5\n290,SERUM-STARVATION MEDIUM,Serum-starvation medium is a nutrient-deficient environment used to induce quiescence in cells by limiting growth factors.,2\n1,SHALLOW QUIESCENCE,\"Shallow quiescence is characterized as a less pronounced state of dormancy in which cells maintain a higher level of responsiveness to growth signals compared to deep quiescence. In this state, cells are more likely to revert to proliferation and are primed to reenter the cell cycle more rapidly upon stimulation. Unlike deep quiescence, where cells exhibit significant metabolic inactivity, shallow quiescence allows for reduced metabolic activity while still retaining some responsiveness to external growth signals. This dynamic state enables cells to be more adaptable and ready for growth when conditions become favorable.\",15\n274,QUIESCENT CELLS,\"Quiescent cells are in a dormant state, characterized by a temporary cessation of cell division and metabolic activity, with varying proliferation potential based on their quiescence depth.\",2\n17,DEEPER QUIESCENCE,\"Deeper quiescence is characterized as a more pronounced state of quiescence in which cells exhibit a reduced responsiveness to growth signals and demonstrate lower metabolic activity. This state necessitates stronger growth signals and extended durations for cells to reenter the cell cycle, indicating a significant alteration in their typical behavior. Overall, deeper quiescence represents a critical phase in cellular dynamics, highlighting the intricate balance between growth and dormancy within the senescence domain.\",6\n273,CELL QUIESCENCE,,1\n302,FRESH-MEDIUM,\"Fresh-medium refers to a culture condition where the medium is regularly replaced, providing continuous nutrients and influencing cellular quiescence.\",1\n16,SHALLOWER QUIESCENCE,Shallower quiescence is a less pronounced state of quiescence that allows cells to respond more quickly to growth signals and reenter the cell cycle.,3\n23,MUSCLE STEM CELLS,\"Muscle stem cells are a specialized type of stem cell that play a crucial role in muscle repair and regeneration. They possess the unique ability to enter a state of quiescence, which is a reversible form of dormancy, allowing them to conserve energy and resources. When tissue injury occurs, these cells can quickly activate and reenter the cell cycle, demonstrating their capacity for rapid response to damage. This ability to enter shallow quiescence enables muscle stem cells to respond efficiently to injuries, ensuring effective muscle regeneration. Additionally, muscle stem cells can switch between reversible quiescence and senescence, further influencing their role in muscle regeneration processes.

The entity \"\"QUIESCENCE\"\" is closely associated with the \"\"SERUM-STARVATION MEDIUM,\"\" which is a specific method employed to induce this quiescent state in cells. The serum-starvation medium plays a crucial role in linking nutrient availability to the cellular state, effectively triggering quiescence by depriving cells of serum nutrients.
