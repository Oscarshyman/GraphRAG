This force plays a significant role in influencing various cellular behaviors, including morphology, migration, growth, and differentiation. Specifically, shear stress affects the quiescent state of cells, impacting their ability to reenter the cell cycle and their activation thresholds. In the context of microchannels, shear stress is particularly relevant as it affects cells adhered to the channel surface, thereby influencing their overall function and behavior. The interplay between shear stress and cellular states, such as quiescence, highlights its importance in understanding cellular dynamics in response to fluid flow.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1747957184, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_54eb4bd693", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 499, "total_tokens": 631, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
