The dormant\nstate, when reversible upon growth signals, is referred to as\ncellular quiescence. Quiescence protects cells against stress and\nirreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many\nphysiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and\ntissue repair (1–4). Consequently, dysregulation of cellular quiescence can lead to a range of hyper- and hypoproliferative\ndiseases, including cancer and aging (5–7).\nIt becomes increasingly recognized that quiescence is a heterogeneous state with graded depth. For example, following injury, muscle and neural stem cells at noninjury sites in the body\nmove adaptively into shallower quiescence (alert or primed\nquiescent phase), positioning cells to more quickly respond to\ninjury and reenter the cell cycle when needed (8, 9). In other\ncases, cells move into deep quiescence and require stronger\ngrowth stimulation and longer times to reenter the cell cycle, as\nseen in hepatocytes upon partial hepatectomy in older rats than\nin younger ones (10, 11). Similarly, the quiescent state deepens\nin cells that are cultured longer under quiescence-inducing signals, such as contact inhibition (12, 13) and serum starvation\n\n22624–22634 | PNAS | November 5, 2019 | vol. 116 | no. 45\n\nAuthor contributions: K.F., R.L., J.X., F.B., and G.Y. designed research; K.F., R.L., H.C., and\nK.D.C. performed research; K.F., R.L., H.C., K.D.C., H.H.Z., J.X., F.B., and G.Y. analyzed\ndata; and K.F., F.B., and G.Y. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no competing interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\nPublished under the PNAS license.\nData deposition: The data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo (accession no.\nGSE124109).\n1\n\nK.F. and R.L. contributed equally to this work.\n\n2\n\nTo whom correspondence may be addressed.

Here we found that the increased lysosomal mass\nin deep quiescent cells is, in part, due to decreased autophagy flux,\nwhich is partially but not fully compensated by increased lysosomal\ngene expression and lysosomal biogenesis. We show that lysosomal\nfunction, like a dimmer switch, continuously regulates quiescence\ndepth and thus the proliferative potential of quiescent cells by reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We\nfound that a set of “senescence core signature” genes (19) show\nsimilar expression patterns in deep quiescence as in senescence, and\nthat a gene-expression signature we developed to indicate cellular\nquiescence depth by comparing deep and shallow quiescent REF\ncells is able to correctly classify senescent and aging cells in a wide\narray of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo (22, 23),\nsuggesting that deep quiescence may serve as a common transition\npath from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\nA\nC\n\nB\n\nDynamic Transcriptome Changes during Quiescence Deepening. Similar\nto our previous observation (14), REF cells moved into deeper\nquiescence progressively with longer-term serum starvation. After\n2-d serum starvation, the entire cell population entered quiescence, as\ndemonstrated by their negative DNA incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2′deoxyuridine (EdU) and a complete shut-off of E2f1 expression (SI\nAppendix, Fig. S1B). E2f1 is a member of the E2f family of transcription factors; it up-regulates a large battery of genes involved in\nDNA replication and cell cycle progression, acting as the key effector of an Rb-E2f bistable switch that controls the all-or-none\ntransition from quiescence to proliferation (24, 25). With increasingly longer serum starvation, cells moved into deeper quiescence, requiring a longer time and a greater serum stimulation\nstrength (concentration) to reenter the cell cycle than cells in\nshallower quiescence. For example, when the duration of serum\nstarvation increased gradually from 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from <19 h to ∼25 h\n(to achieve ∼60% EdU+ rate) (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1C),\nand the serum concentration required for cell cycle reentry increased from <2% to ∼8% (to achieve ∼60% EdU+ measured at\nthe 25th hour of serum stimulation) (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with our earlier findings that the time and serum threshold\nrequired for cell cycle reentry are 2 related features that both reflect\nthe same biological state, the quiescence depth (14).
