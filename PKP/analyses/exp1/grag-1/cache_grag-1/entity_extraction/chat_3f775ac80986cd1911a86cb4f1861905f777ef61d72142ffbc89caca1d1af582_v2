Instead, we found that autophagy\nflux, an indicator for the primary lysosomal function, did not increase but gradually declined as cells moved deeper into quiescence,\nas seen in an LC3-II turnover assay (32) (Fig. 3A). This result posed\n2 immediate questions: 1) What is the relationship between increased lysosomal mass and gene expression to decreased lysosomal\nfunction? 2) Does declined lysosomal function cause quiescence\ndeepening and, if so, how?\nAn increase of lysosomal mass can be caused by an increase of\nlysosome biogenesis or a decrease of lysosome destruction or\nboth. Since lysosome itself is destructed via an autophagic process named lysophagy (33, 34), the declined autophagy flux we\nobserved in cells with prolonged serum starvation (Fig. 3A)\nsuggests that the rate of lysosome destruction likely declines\naccordingly in deep quiescence. If this is the case, when we inhibit autophagy/losophagy, we expect that 1) lysosomal mass will\nincrease in cells, and 2) the degree of increase (fold-change) will\nbe smaller in deep than shallow quiescent cells. Indeed, when we\ntreated 2-, 5-, and 8-d serum-starved quiescent cells with an\nautophagy inhibitor (nocodazole or vinblastine) (35) to repress\nautophagy/lysophagy (as seen by decreased autophagy flux in\nLC3 turnover assay) (Fig. 3B), we found that the relative increase of LysoTracker intensity was smaller in cells under prolonged starvation (Fig. 3 C and D). Although the result should be\ntaken with caveat since nocodazole and vinblastine are general\nautophagy inhibitors but not specific lysophagy inhibitors (which\nare lacking in the field to the best of our knowledge), and thus\nmay cause other side effects, this result, together with decreased\nautophagy (Fig. 3A), suggested that lysosome destruction decreased as quiescence deepened. Insufficient lysosome destruction by autophagy/lysophagy can lead to an accumulation of\ndamaged lysosomes in the cell, which in turn interferes with lysosomal homeostasis and function (34).\nInterestingly, while blocking autophagy/lysophagy by either\nnocodazole or vinblastine increased the LysoTracker intensity in\nquiescent REF cells, it did not increase the number of lysosomes\n(SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and C) and even decreased the lysosomal\nnumber over time (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 B and D). This result is\ndifferent from the increased lysosomal number we observed,\nalong with quiescence deepening (Fig. 2H); it suggests that decreased lysosome destruction was not the only factor contributing to the increase of lysosomal mass in deep quiescent cells.\nIndeed, increased lysosome biogenesis (consistent with the increased lysosomal gene expression, as seen in Fig. 2 E and F) also\nplayed a role in this process, as we will explain further in the\nDiscussion. Altogether, our study suggests that increased lysosomal mass (containing damaged lysosomes) is both partially\ncaused by and contributes to decreased lysosomal function and\nautophagic clearance in deep quiescence.\nInhibiting Lysosomal Function Deepens Cellular Quiescence. Our next\nquestion concerns whether the decreased lysosomal function is\ncausal to, or merely a consequence of, deep quiescence. If decreased lysosomal function causes deep quiescence, we expect\nthat inhibiting lysosomal function in quiescent cells would further deepen quiescence and that increasing lysosomal function\nwould lead to shallow quiescence.\nTo test this idea, we first performed pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal function and measured corresponding\nchanges in quiescence depth (Fig. 4A). As seen in Fig. 1 A and B,\ndeep quiescent cells under longer-term serum starvation both\nrequire a higher serum concentration and take a longer time to\nFujimaki et al.\n\nD\nC\n\nFig. 3.
