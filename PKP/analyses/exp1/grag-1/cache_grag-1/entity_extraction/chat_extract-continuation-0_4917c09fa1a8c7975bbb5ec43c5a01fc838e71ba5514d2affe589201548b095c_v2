The enriched up-regulation of lysosomal genes\n(KEGG_lysosome gene set) is shown in 10 of the 11 studied\naging tissues (adrenal gland, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung,\nspleen, thymus, uterus, testis, but not muscle); it is also shown\nin 5 of the 6 cell lines (BJ, IMR-90, WI-38, HFF, MRC-5, but\nnot MDAH041) studied under replicative senescence, but not\nshown in stress (Adriamycin/5-aza/H2O2)-induced senescence in\nMDAH041 cells (SI Appendix, Table S4). This result is consistent\nwith the findings that senescence and aging are partially driven\nby ROS and can be counteracted by lysosome–autophagy activities in many but not all conditions (6, 15, 17, 61–63), indicating\nthe contributions of other potentially shared mechanisms underlying deep quiescence, senescence, and aging. Among them,\nDNA damage is a likely candidate, which can be caused by\nvarious stress signals (e.g., ROS and replication stress) and is\nassociated with quiescence entry (64, 65) as well as cellular senescence (66, 67) and aging (68, 69). Furthermore, many cellular\nactivities are up- or down-regulated as cells move deeper in\nquiescence (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). Some of these cellular activities may be involved in the regulation of quiescence depth and\npotentially senescence and aging, with their detailed mechanisms\nawaiting further studies. In this regard, it has been shown recently\nin both NSCs and bacteria that the accumulation of protein aggregates is associated with quiescence deepening, and that the\nclearance of protein aggregates (by lysosomes in NSCs and by\nDnaK–ClpB complex in bacteria) drives cells to shallower quiescence and enhances their ability to reenter the cell cycle (39, 70).\nQuiescence entry and exit are regulated by the Rb-E2f-Cyclin/\nCdk gene network (71, 72) that functions as a bistable switch\n(25). How does the toggle switch-like nature of the Rb-E2f\npathway fit with the lysosomal dimmer switch? We speculate\nthat during quiescence exit, cells first move progressively into\nshallow quiescence and at a time point, the restriction point (73,\n74), “flip” into the cell cycle by committing to proliferation; the\nwhole process acts like adjusting a sliding dimmer before activating\na toggle switch. In this regard, it will be important to figure out\nwhether and how the lysosomal switch cross-talks with the Rb-E2f\nswitch in controlling quiescence depth and exit in future studies.\nRelatedly, recent in vivo studies on muscle and neural stem\ncells generally invoke 2 quiescence state: 1 shallow (e.g., GAlert\nand primed quiescence) and 1 deep. Our findings that the geneexpression signature we developed in the fibroblast model\nFujimaki et al.\n\n\fCell Culture and Quiescence Induction. REFs used in this study are from a singlecell clone derived from REF52 cells and contain a stably integrated human\nE2F1 promoter-driven destabilized EGFP (E2f-GFP) reporter, as previously\ndescribed [i.e., REF/E23 cells (25, 82)] unless otherwise noted. Cells were\npassaged every 2 to 3 d and maintained at subconfluency in growth medium: DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (BGS; GE\nHealthcare, SH30541). To induce quiescence, cells were plated at ∼50%\nconfluence in growth medium for a day, washed twice with DMEM, and\ncultured in serum-starvation medium (DMEM containing 0.02% BGS) for the\nindicated duration (≥2 d).\nQuiescence-Depth Assay. To assess quiescence depth, cells were switched from\nserum-starvation medium to serum-stimulation medium (DMEM containing\nBGS at indicated concentrations) and harvested at indicated time points by\ntrypsinization. The cell fraction that reentered the cell cycle was quantified by\nassessing the profile of EdU incorporation (and the profiles of E2f-GFP reporter and PI DNA staining when indicated). Quiescence depth is determined\nby the serum threshold required to activate cells to reenter the cell cycle. At a\ngiven serum concentration, a smaller percentage of deeper quiescent cells are\nable to reenter the cell cycle by a given time than of shallower quiescent cells.\nSee text for details.\nData Availability.
