In parallel, other cellular pathways impinge on the Rb–E2F switch and modulate its switch threshold. This modulatory effect may occur through crosstalk with various gene nodes in the Rb–E2F switch network, most effectively by affecting G1 cyclin and CDK activities in the cell [13,28,69]. Higher thresholds lead to deeper quiescence and, eventually, senescence when physiological growth signals can no longer overcome the threshold [27,41]. Therefore, the difference between deep quiescence and senescence lies primarily in the magnitude of the Rb–E2F switch threshold rather than in fundamentally distinct cellular characteristics, aligning with the quiescence–senescence continuum model.        The lysosomal–autophagy axis discussed above driving quiescence-to-senescence transition in MuSCs directly increases the Rb–E2F switch threshold (by activating p16 that inhibits CDK activity) [13,18]. Similarly, increasing the Rb–E2F switch threshold has been reported to drive deep quiescence in MuSCs via fasting-induced ketone body signaling (by increasing p21 that inhibits CDK) [69]. This threshold mechanism predicts a potential way to reverse the “irreversible” senescence by reducing the Rb–E2F switch threshold. Indeed, studies have shown that senescent cells can be reactivated as such, e.g., by inactivating Rb, p53–p21, or p16 activities [70,71,72,73,74,75] or by the forced G1 cyclin upregulation [76].                    3.3. Remaining Unknowns and the Heterogeneity in Quiescence-Origin Senescence        Several key areas remain to be explored. The role of mTOR signaling, for instance, presents an intriguing paradox. mTOR is a major driver of proliferation-origin senescence, underlying the process of geroconversion—a process in which mTOR-driven cell growth continues aberrantly after the cell cycle is blocked (e.g., by CDK inhibitors p21CIP1/Waf1 and p16INK4a) [11,77]. In quiescence, mTOR is inactive and cells lack sustained growth, which has been proposed as a mechanism to protect quiescent cells against senescence [11,77]. This questions the involvement of mTOR in quiescence deepening and the quiescence-origin senescence, which aligns with the fact that mTOR activity is linked to shallow quiescence (GAlert) [42], not quiescence deepening. Therefore, the quiescence-origin senescence appears different from proliferation-origin senescence from the aspect of mTOR and geroconversion (Figure 1).        Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in proliferation-origin senescence, including the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) that repress E2F target genes [78] and changes in DNA methylation and histone modification patterns [79,80]. Epigenetic mechanisms are also involved in quiescence deepening and transition to senescence, as seen in the ROS-mediated derepression of the p16 locus [18] and the role of ketone body-mediated acetylation and activation of the p53 locus [69] in MuSCs as well as the long-observed increase in chromatin condensation in deep quiescent cells [37]. However, a comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic landscape changes during quiescence deepening and the quiescence-to-senescence transition is still lacking, highlighting an important area for future research [40].        The heterogeneity and context dependency of the quiescence-to-senescence transition are also apparent, underscoring the complexity of these cellular processes. For instance, ROS-mediated p16INK4a activation occurs through epigenetic derepression in MuSCs [18] but via p38 MAPK hyperactivation in HSPCs [14]. Blocking p16INK4a activation prevents the quiescence-to-senescence transition only in a subset of cells [13], suggesting the involvement of other molecular effectors driving the quiescence-origin senescence. Furthermore, is lysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition to senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb–E2F switch threshold—or possibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream E2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]? Growing cells exiting from either the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle converge onto the same senescent state with a G1-like molecular signature [76]. How about quiescence-origin senescence? What are its molecular markers, and to what extent do they overlap with or differ from the markers of proliferation-origin senescence, beyond the sustained (if not totally irreversible) arrested phenotype (Figure 1)? Future investigations are needed to find the answers.                    4. Conclusions      Unlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence involves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously understudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1).
