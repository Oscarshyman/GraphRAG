Shear stress, generated by the flow of extracellular fluid, significantly influences the characteristics and actions of quiescent cells, thereby affecting their quiescence depth. Furthermore, it has been observed that shear stress not only impacts the morphology of these cells but also promotes their exit from quiescence, highlighting a direct relationship between fluid dynamics and the cellular state. This interplay suggests that the mechanical environment, characterized by shear stress, plays a crucial role in regulating the transition of cells from a quiescent state to an active state, underscoring the importance of understanding these dynamics in the study of cellular behavior.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1747957189, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_54eb4bd693", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 426, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
