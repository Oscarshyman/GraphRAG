This measure reflects the activation of the E2F transcription factor, which is known to increase with flow rate, thereby demonstrating cellular responsiveness to growth signals. Specifically, E2F-ON% quantifies the percentage of cells that have transitioned from a quiescent state to an active state, particularly in response to serum stimulation and fluid flow conditions. The E2F-GFP reporter is utilized to indicate this transition, highlighting the cells that have exited quiescence and entered an active state. Overall, E2F-ON% is a vital metric for understanding cellular dynamics in the context of growth and proliferation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1747957182, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_92e0377081", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 400, "total_tokens": 559, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
