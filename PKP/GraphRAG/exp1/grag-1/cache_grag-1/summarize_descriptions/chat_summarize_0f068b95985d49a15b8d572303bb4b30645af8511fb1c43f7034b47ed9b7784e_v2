This dormant, non-proliferative state allows cells to exit the cell cycle while maintaining the potential to proliferate upon receiving appropriate physiological signals. Quiescence can vary in depth and is believed to play a crucial role in preserving stem cell function and protecting cells from irreversible arrest. It serves as a reversible state of cellular dormancy that can persist over prolonged periods, contributing to tissue homeostasis and repair. Under certain conditions, such as stress or aging, quiescent cells may transition to senescence. Overall, quiescence is essential for maintaining cellular viability under growth-limiting conditions while enabling a return to active proliferation when favorable conditions arise.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1747957180, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_92e0377081", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 536, "total_tokens": 703, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
