Shear stress, which arises from the flow of extracellular fluid, plays a crucial role in influencing the depth of quiescence in cells. This mechanical force not only affects the quiescent state but also modulates the cells' sensitivity to growth signals. Furthermore, shear stress is implicated in promoting the exit from quiescence, highlighting its dual role in both maintaining and transitioning cells out of this dormant state. Overall, the interplay between shear stress and quiescence underscores the importance of mechanical forces in regulating cellular dynamics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1747957191, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_54eb4bd693", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 439, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
