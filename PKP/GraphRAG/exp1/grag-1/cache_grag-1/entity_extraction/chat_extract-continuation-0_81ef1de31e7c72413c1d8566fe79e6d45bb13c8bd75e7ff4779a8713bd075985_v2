As a result, exposed to a faster extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow, cells\nbecome more sensitive to serum growth signals and more likely to\nreenter the cell cycle.\nSeveral questions are left unanswered in our study. First, the\nmolecular mechanisms are to be identiﬁed by which ﬂow-induced\nshear stress and extracellular factor replacement lower the\nactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.\nInterestingly, increasing medium viscosity (by a higher dextran\nconcentration) promotes quiescence exit under a medium ﬂow\n(Figure 4), but it inhibits quiescence exit in static medium\n(Supplementary Figure S2). This result may be associated\n\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nwith medium viscosity-induced changes in certain lipoprotein\nsynthesis (Yedgar et al., 1982), cytoskeleton and cell morphology\n(Khorshid, 2005), cell attachment and inﬂammation (Rouleau\net al., 2010), or other cellular activities that inhibit quiescence exit\nin static medium. These changes, if also present under continuous\nmedium ﬂow, appear to be surpassed by the effects of shear stress\nthat promote quiescence exit. The exact mechanism needs to be\ninvestigated in future studies. Additionally, quiescent cells\ncultured in the microﬂuidic device appear to be generally\ndeeper in quiescence than those cultured in well plates under\notherwise the same conditions (e.g., comparing the E2f-On%\nupon 2% serum stimulation in microdevice (Figure 3) and that in\nthe comparable condition in well plate (Supplementary Figure\nS2), both being in static medium, 0 μl/h, and without added\ndextran). We speculate this difference may be due to the different\nsurfaces that cells were attached to (glass in the microchannel\nversus plastic in the well plate), or different medium height\n(<0.5 mm in the microchannel versus 3–4 mm in the well\nplate) that could result in different nutrient/factor availability,\ngas/heat exchange etc., or both. The exact mechanism needs to be\nfurther investigated. Nevertheless, the current study\ndemonstrated, for the ﬁrst time to our best knowledge, the\ndirect effects of extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow and its corresponding\ncomponents (shear stress and extracellular factor replacement)\non cell quiescence depth.\nIndividual quiescent cells in vivo, including stem and\nprogenitor cells in their tissue niches, experience interstitial\nﬂuid ﬂows with varying rates and viscosities depending on\nlocal tissue structures and distances from nearby blood vessels.\nThe ﬂow-driven heterogeneity in cellular quiescence depth, as\ndemonstrated in this study, may shed light on the heterogeneous\nresponses of quiescent cells in tissue repair and regeneration in\ndifferent physiological contexts of living tissues.\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in\nthe article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be\ndirected to the corresponding authors.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nBL, LJ, JX, YZ, and GY designed research; BL performed\nexperiments; XW performed mathematical modeling and\nsimulation; LJ designed, fabricated, and conﬁgured the\nmicroﬂuidic system; BL, LJ, and GY analyzed data; BL, YZ, LJ,\nand GY wrote the paper.\n\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by grants from the NSF of USA\n(#2016035 and #3038431 to GY), the Startup Fund for\nscientiﬁc research of Fujian Medical University (#2017XQ2016\nto BL), and the NSF of China (#31500676 to XW).\n\n10\n\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 792719\n\n\fLiu et al.\n\nExtracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescence\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\naverage E2f-On% or EdU+% as indicated from duplicate samples (black and\ngrey histograms).
