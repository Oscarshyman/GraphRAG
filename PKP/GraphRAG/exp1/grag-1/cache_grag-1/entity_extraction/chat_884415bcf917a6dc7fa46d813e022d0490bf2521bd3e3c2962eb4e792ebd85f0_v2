Recent studies have shown that quiescence is not a passive and\nhomogeneous state but actively maintained and heterogeneous. These cellular\ncharacteristics associated with quiescence were observed primarily in cultured cells\nunder a static medium. However, cells in vivo face different microenvironmental\nconditions, particularly, under interstitial ﬂuid ﬂows distributed through extracellular\nmatrices. Interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow exerts shear stress on cells and matrix strain, and results\nin continuous replacement of extracellular factors. In this study, we analyzed individual cells\nunder varying ﬂuid ﬂow rates in microﬂuidic devices. We found quiescence characteristics\npreviously identiﬁed under conventional static medium, including serum signal-dependant\nquiescence entry and exit and time-dependant quiescence deepening, are also present\nunder continuous ﬂuid ﬂow. Furthermore, increasing the ﬂow rate drives cells to shallower\nquiescence and become more likely to reenter the cell cycle upon growth stimulation. This\neffect is due to ﬂow-induced physical and biochemical cues. Speciﬁcally, increasing shear\nstress or extracellular factor replacement individually, without altering other parameters,\nresults in shallow quiescence. We show our experimental results can be quantitatively\nexplained by a mathematical model connecting extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow to an Rb-E2f bistable\nswitch that regulates the quiescence-to-proliferation transition. Our ﬁndings uncover a\npreviously unappreciated mechanism that likely underlies the heterogeneous responses of\nquiescent cells for tissue repair and regeneration in different physiological tissue\nmicroenvironments.\nKeywords: cellular quiescence, quiescence depth, extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow, ﬂow shear stress, extracellular factors,\nmicroenvironment, microﬂuidics, mathematical model\n\nINTRODUCTION\nQuiescence is a dormant, non-proliferative cellular state. Quiescent cells, however, still maintain the\npotential to proliferate upon physiological signals, making them distinct from other dormant cells\nthat are irreversibly arrested, such as those in senescence or terminal differentiation. Activating\nquiescent cells (e.g., adult stem and progenitor cells) to proliferate is fundamental to tissue\nhomeostasis and repair (Coller et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2008; Li and Clevers, 2010; Cheung\nand Rando, 2013). Quiescence has long been viewed as a passive cellular state lacking cell cycle\n\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n1\n\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 792719\n\n\fLiu et al.\n\nExtracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescence\n\nactivity. Recent studies, however, have revealed that quiescence is\nrather actively maintained and highly heterogeneous (Coller\net al., 2006; Sang et al., 2008; Cheung and Rando, 2013;\nSpencer et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017).\nThe heterogeneity of quiescent cells in their proliferation\npotential can be described as a graded depth. Cells in deeper\nquiescence require stronger growth stimulation and take longer\nto exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle than in shallower\nquiescence (Augenlicht and Baserga, 1974; Kwon et al., 2017;\nFujimaki et al., 2019).
