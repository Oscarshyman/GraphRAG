Lysosomal gene expression and biogenesis can be up-regulated\nby a MiT/TFE family of transcription factors Tfeb, Mitf, and Tfe3,\nwhich bind to a CLEAR-box sequence upstream of many lysosomal\ngenes and are known as the master regulator of lysosome biogenesis\nFujimaki et al.\n\n\fA\n\nB\n\nEdU+ level upon serum stimulation (normalized to mCherry control) (y axis in Fig. 5G), suggesting that cells can be continuously\ndriven to shallower quiescence by enhancing lysosomal function.\nLysosomal Function Prevents Quiescence Deepening via ROS Reduction.\n\nLysosomes are known to play an antioxidative role in quiescent\nstem cells (15, 16). Thus, here we tested whether lysosomal\nfunction potentially prevents quiescence deepening by antioxidation. If it does, we reasoned that increasing antioxidation in\nthe cell would reduce quiescence depth. Indeed, we found that\nsupplementing antioxidant 2-mercaptoethanol (βME) drove\nquiescent cells into a shallower state, from which cells became\nmore sensitive to growth signals (higher EdU+% upon serum\nstimulation) (Fig. 6A); conversely, supplementing an oxidative\nreagent tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) drove cells into deeper\nquiescence, shown by the lower EdU+% (Fig. 6B) and lower E2fON% (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A) upon stimulation at a given serum\nconcentration with increasing tBHP concentration.
