This result is consistent with our earlier findings that the time and serum threshold\nrequired for cell cycle reentry are 2 related features that both reflect\nthe same biological state, the quiescence depth (14). Importantly,\ndeep quiescent cells were not irreversibly arrested. For example,\nupon 20% serum stimulation, 92.6% of 16-d serum-starved deep\nquiescent REF cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU+)\nwithin 41 h (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).\nTo identify molecular mechanisms regulating quiescence\ndepth at the transcriptional level, we performed RNA-sequencing\n(RNA-seq) analysis of 0- to 16-d serum-starved cells (26). As\nexpected, the expression of well-characterized proliferation\ngenes—such as E2f1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A)—\nE2f1 target genes (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B), and proliferationrelated gene clusters (#7 and 9, SI Appendix, Fig. S2C) was\nquickly down-regulated within 2-d serum starvation. Conversely,\nthe expression of growth inhibitory genes, such as Rb1, Cdkn1a\n(p21Cip1), and Cdkn1b (p27Kip1), was up-regulated upon serum starvation (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). The expression of Cdkn2a\n(p16INK4A), a senescence marker (27), remained low as cells\nmoved deeper in quiescence (3- to 16-d serum starvation) (SI\nAppendix, Fig. S2D), consistent with quiescence being a\nreversible state.\nThe global gene-expression profile changed drastically when\ncells transitioned from proliferation to quiescence (0- to 2-d\nserum starvation) and continued to change sequentially as cells\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (2- to 16-d serum starvation) (Fig. 1C). This sequential change was reflected in 9 gene\nclusters that exhibited different temporal dynamic patterns (Fig.\n2 A and B). In particular, the expression of 2 gene clusters\nappeared to be positively correlated with quiescence deepening\nFujimaki et al.\n\nFig. 1.

Cells in duplicated wells (n = 2) were harvested 19, 22, and 25 h after 20% serum stimulation (A), or 25 h after\nstimulation with serum at indicated concentrations (0.02 to 20%) (B).

In cluster 3, lysosome was the single function\nsignificantly enriched statistically (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). Consistently, lysosomal genes also had the strongest positive correlation with deep quiescence in gene set enrichment analysis\n(GSEA) (30) (normalized enrichment score [NES] = 3.12)\n(Fig. 2D).\nLysosomal Gene Expression and Lysosomal Mass Increase as Quiescence\nDeepens. The vast majority of lysosomal genes, encoding for various\n\nlysosomal enzymes, activator proteins, membrane proteins, and ion\nchannel proteins, increased their expression continuously as cells\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (Fig. 2E [cluster C and the\nbottom half of cluster A], Fig. 2F, and SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). As a\ncomparison, the expression of most genes associated with endosomes, another cellular organelle in the endosomal–lysosomal system, only increased significantly during the first 2 d of serum\nstarvation but not afterward as quiescence continued to deepen\n(Fig. 2F and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B and C).\nLysosomal mass also increased in deep quiescence: Following\na brief pulsatile adaptive response (within the first 6 h) upon\nserum starvation, lysosomal mass continuously increased over\nthe next 14 d, as seen from the stained LysoTracker intensity\n(Fig. 2G).
