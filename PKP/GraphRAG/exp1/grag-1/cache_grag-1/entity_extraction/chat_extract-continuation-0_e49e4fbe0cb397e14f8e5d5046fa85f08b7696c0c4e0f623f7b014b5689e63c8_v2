Recent research, however, has revealed a novel pathway termed “quiescenceorigin senescence”, where cells directly transition into senescence from the quiescent state, bypassing\ncell proliferation and growth. This opinion paper presents a framework conceptualizing a continuum\nbetween quiescence and senescence with quiescence deepening as a precursor to senescence entry.\nWe explore the triggers and controllers of this process and discuss its biological implications. Given\nthat the majority of cells in the human body are dormant rather than proliferative, understanding\nquiescence-origin senescence has significant implications for tissue homeostasis, aging, cancer, and\nvarious disease processes. The new paradigm in exploring this previously overlooked senescent cell\npopulation may reshape our intervention strategies for age-related diseases and tissue regeneration.\nKeywords: quiescence; senescence; quiescence deepening; dormancy state continuum; Rb–E2F\nswitch threshold; geroconversion\n\n1.

It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and fibrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physiological growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senescent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines 2024, 12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\n\n\fBiomedicines 2024, 12, 1837\n\n2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16]. This phenomenon, which we term “quiescence-origin senescence”,\nsuggests a fluid continuum between quiescence and senescence with profound implications\nfor tissue homeostasis, aging, and disease processes. Notably, proliferating cells account\nfor less than 1% of the thirty-seven trillion cells in the human body at any given time [17],\nsuggesting that quiescence-origin senescence may underlie a large proportion of previously\noverlooked or misclassified senescent cells.\nThis brief review synthesizes recent findings to provide a new framework for understanding senescence from the perspective of cell dormancy–state plasticity, aiming to\nstimulate further related research into novel intervention strategies for age-related diseases,\ncancer, and regenerative medicine.\n2.
