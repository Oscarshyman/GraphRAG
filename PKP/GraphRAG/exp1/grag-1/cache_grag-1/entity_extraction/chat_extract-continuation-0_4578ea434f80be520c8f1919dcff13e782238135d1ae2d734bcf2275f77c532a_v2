Cells in deeper\nquiescence require stronger growth stimulation and take longer\nto exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle than in shallower\nquiescence (Augenlicht and Baserga, 1974; Kwon et al., 2017;\nFujimaki et al., 2019). Hepatocytes in older rats are an example of\ndeeper quiescent cells, displaying a longer delay before reentering\nthe cell cycle and reinitiating DNA replication following partial\nhepatectomy, as compared to those in younger rats (Bucher,\n1963). Certain muscle and neural stem cells after tissue injury are\nexamples of shallow quiescent cells, primed to reenter the cell\ncycle faster upon the next damage (Rodgers et al., 2014; LlorensBobadilla et al., 2015). The dysregulation of cellular quiescence\ndepth can lead to disrupted tissue homeostasis, exhibiting either\nan insufﬁcient number of growing cells due to an abnormally\ndeep quiescence, or a depleted pool of quiescent stem and\nprogenitor cells due to an abnormally shallow quiescence\n(Orford and Scadden, 2008; Cheung and Rando, 2013;\nFujimaki and Yao, 2020).\nAlthough dormant and non-proliferative, quiescent cells\nreside in and interact with dynamic microenvironments. A\nparticular microenvironmental factor is the interstitial ﬂuid\nﬂowing over tissue cells, which transports nutrients and other\ndissolved molecules that inﬂuence cellular activities (Jain,\n1987; Swartz and Fleury, 2007; Freund et al., 2012; Yao et al.,\n2013). Interstitial ﬂow also generates mechanical shear stress\non cells, which affects cell morphology, migration, growth,\nand differentiation (Jain, 1987; Ng and Swartz, 2003; Tarbell\net al., 2005; Swartz and Fleury, 2007; Polacheck et al., 2011;\nShirure et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019). To date, though,\ncellular quiescence has been mostly studied in cell cultures\nunder static medium or in animal models without examining\nthe effects of interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow. Whether and how\nextracellular ﬂuid ﬂow affects cellular quiescence remain\nlargely unknown.\nIn this study, we examined the effects of extracellular ﬂuid\nﬂow on cellular quiescence depth using a microﬂuidic system\nwith a controllable medium ﬂow rate. First, we found many\nquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell cultures\nunder a static medium were also present in the microﬂuidic\nsystem under continuous medium ﬂow. Furthermore, the\nmedium ﬂow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,\nthe likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.\nThis result was further explained by the combined effect of\nﬂow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellular\nsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental results\nwere integrated into a mathematic model that helps\nunderstand and predict how extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow\nmodulates quiescence depth. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis study is the ﬁrst to characterize the effects of extracellular\nﬂuid ﬂow on cellular quiescence, which could help better\nunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells for\n\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org\n\ntissue repair and regeneration in different physiological\ncontexts of living tissues.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nMicroﬂuidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA microﬂuidic system was developed to study cellular quiescence\nunder medium ﬂow. To obtain sufﬁcient numbers of cells for ﬂow\ncytometry analyses, a microﬂuidic device was designed featuring\na straight channel 420 μm in height, 4 mm in width, and 4 cm in\nlength. The microdevices, made of optically transparent\npolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning\nCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging of\ncells during experimentation.\nThe device fabrication process, illustrated in Figure 1, started\nwith the fabrication of a master mold. The mold with features of\nmicrochannel patterns was made in an aluminum block using a\ncomputer numerical control (CNC) machine based on a 3D\nComputer-Aided Design (CAD). PDMS mixture, consisting of\n10:1 base and curing agent, was poured onto the mold. After air\nbubble removal from the mixture under vacuum, the PDMS was\ncured at 55°C for 3 h. The cured PDMS substrate was then peeled\noff the mold with formed microchannel grooves (Figure 1A).\nAfter punching inlet and outlet holes at the two ends of a channel,\nthe PDMS microchannel was bonded with a glass slide following\noxygen plasma treatment of the bonding surfaces (Figure 1B).\nNext, a pair of inlet and outlet tubing adapters was assembled for\neach device to connect the microchannel to the external ﬂow\ncontrol system. The device fabrication and packaging were\ncompleted with incubation at\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENT CELLS<|>CELLULAR STATE<|>Quiescent cells are in a dormant state, characterized by a temporary cessation of cell division and metabolic activity, with varying proliferation potential based on their quiescence depth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Deep quiescence is a state where cells require stronger growth stimulation and take longer to exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Shallow quiescence is a less pronounced state of quiescence where cells are primed to reenter the cell cycle faster upon stimulation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>CELLULAR STATE<|>Hepatocytes are liver cells that can enter a deeper quiescent state, exhibiting a longer delay before reentering the cell cycle after partial hepatectomy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS<|>STEM CELLS<|>Muscle stem cells are a type of stem cell that can enter shallow quiescence and are primed to reenter the cell cycle quickly after tissue injury.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURAL STEM CELLS<|>STEM CELLS<|>Neural stem cells are stem cells that can also enter shallow quiescence and are capable of rapid reentry into the cell cycle following damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS<|>CELLULAR STATE<|>Tissue homeostasis refers to the balance of cell proliferation and quiescence necessary for maintaining healthy tissue function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLUID FLOW<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLUID FLOW<|>Extracellular fluid flow is the movement of fluid outside of cells, which can influence cellular activities and quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEAR STRESS<|>SHEAR STRESS<|>Shear stress is the mechanical force exerted by fluid flow on cells, affecting their morphology, migration, growth, and differentiation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>A microfluidic system is a technology that allows for the manipulation of fluids at a microscale, used to study cellular behaviors under controlled conditions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENT CELLS<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescent cells can exist in a state of deep quiescence, requiring stronger stimulation to exit this state and reenter the cell cycle.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENT CELLS<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescent cells can also exist in shallow quiescence, which allows for quicker reentry into the cell cycle upon stimulation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>Hepatocytes in older rats exhibit deep quiescence, leading to a longer delay in reentering the cell cycle after liver injury.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>Muscle stem cells can enter shallow quiescence, allowing them to quickly reenter the cell cycle after tissue damage.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURAL STEM CELLS<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>Neural stem cells also enter shallow quiescence, enabling rapid reentry into the cell cycle following injury.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS<|>The regulation of quiescence depth is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, as imbalances can lead to insufficient or excessive cell proliferation.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLUID FLOW<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Extracellular fluid flow influences the quiescence state of cells, affecting their behavior and response to growth signals.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEAR STRESS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Shear stress generated by extracellular fluid flow affects the morphology and behavior of quiescent cells, impacting their quiescence depth.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The microfluidic system is used to study the effects of fluid flow on cellular quiescence, providing controlled experimental conditions.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
