This connection underscores the importance of dextran as a factor in the regulation of quiescence, illustrating how nutrient dynamics can impact cellular activity and states of dormancy.\",91\n408,QUIESCENCE,STEM CELLS,\"Stem cells can enter a quiescent state in their niches, which is crucial for maintaining their long-term functionality and regenerative potential.\",91\n409,QUIESCENCE,PROGENITOR CELLS,\"Progenitor cells may enter quiescence based on local tissue conditions, affecting their ability to differentiate and proliferate.\",91\n410,QUIESCENCE,CELL ATTACHMENT,\"Cell attachment to different surfaces can influence the quiescent state of cells, impacting their metabolic activity and responsiveness to signals.\",91\n411,QUIESCENCE,INFLAMMATION,\"Inflammation can modulate the quiescent state of cells, affecting their behavior in tissue repair and regeneration.\",91\n412,E2F-GFP,QUIESCENCE,\"The E2F-GFP reporter indicates the quiescent state of cells, showing a relationship between gene expression and cellular state.\",91\n415,QUIESCENCE,CELL CYCLE REGULATION,\"Cell cycle regulation is essential for the entry and exit of quiescence, influencing cellular responses to environmental signals.\",91\n416,QUIESCENCE,FLOW SHEAR STRESS,\"Flow shear stress can affect the quiescent state of cells, demonstrating the impact of mechanical forces on cellular behavior.\",91\n\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}}
