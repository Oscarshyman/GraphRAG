-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [cellular state, quiescence, senescence, gene network, microfluidic system, extracellular fluid flow, shear stress, autophagy, stem cells, fibroblasts, gene expression, protein aggregates]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Flow Rate and Flow-Induced Shear Stress
The total volume of medium in a microdevice (including tubing
at the inlet/outlet of the channel but not connectors, Figure 1C) is
approximately 140 μl, and the medium volume in the
microﬂuidic channel alone is about 67 µl. In this study, a
continuous medium ﬂow with a ﬁxed ﬂow rate (5 or 20 μl/h)
was fed into the channel to mimic the typical interstitial ﬂow
velocity in soft tissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007) unless otherwise
noted. Correspondingly, the ﬂow rate, rather than the priming
volume, is used to characterize the ﬂow effect. We also consider
the concentration of the bulk ﬂuid is uniform spatially, and local
diffusion and convection at the interfaces between the �

text:
 accumulation of protein aggregates is associated with quiescence deepening, and that the
clearance of protein aggregates (by lysosomes in NSCs and by
DnaK–ClpB complex in bacteria) drives cells to shallower quiescence and enhances their ability to reenter the cell cycle (39, 70).
Quiescence entry and exit are regulated by the Rb-E2f-Cyclin/
Cdk gene network (71, 72) that functions as a bistable switch
(25). How does the toggle switch-like nature of the Rb-E2f
pathway fit with the lysosomal dimmer switch? We speculate
that during quiescence exit, cells first move progressively into
shallow quiescence and at a time point, the restriction point (73,
74), “flip” into the cell cycle by committing to proliferation; the
whole process acts like adjusting a sliding dimmer before activating
a toggle switch. In this

. Here we measured
transcriptome changes as rat embryonic fibroblasts moved from
shallow to deep quiescence over time in the absence of growth
signals. We found that lysosomal gene expression was significantly
up-regulated in deep quiescence, and partially compensated for gradually reduced autophagy flux. Reducing lysosomal function drove
cells progressively deeper into quiescence and eventually into a
senescence-like irreversibly arrested state; increasing lysosomal function, by lowering oxidative stress, progressively pushed cells into
shallower quiescence. That is, lysosomal function modulates graded
quiescence depth between proliferation and senescence as a dimmer
switch. Finally, we found that a gene-expression signature developed
by comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can correctly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro
and in vivo, suggesting that while quiescence is generally considered
