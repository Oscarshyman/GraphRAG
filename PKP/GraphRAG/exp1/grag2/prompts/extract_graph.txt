This brief review synthesizes recent findings to provide a new framework for understanding senescence from the perspective of cell dormancy–state plasticity, aiming to
stimulate further related research into novel intervention strategies for age-related diseases,
cancer, and regenerative medicine.
2. The Quiescence–Senescence Continuum: A Framework for Understanding
Quiescence-Origin Senescence
2.1. Direct Transition from Quiescence to Senescence
Mounting evidence in the past decade demonstrates a direct transition to senescence in
quiescent cells under stress or with aging. One of the first reports of this phenomenon was
in geriatric mice, where quiescent satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MuSCs) lose regenerative
capacity and become irreversibly arrested [13]. The same observation was confirmed in
geriatric human muscle, suggesting a conserved mechanism contributing to age-related
decline in muscle regenerative capacity [13]. The quiescence-to-senescence transition in
geriatric MuSCs was linked to the epigenetic derepression of p16INK4a , which is a key
regulator of senescence [13].
Further research revealed that p16INK4a derepression in geriatric MuSCs was triggered
by accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from failed autophagy [18]. Restoring autophagy prevents the transition to senescence in quiescent MuSCs [18]. Similarly,
in quiescent human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), stress-induced ROS
accumulation can elevate the p16INK4a level and drive the transition to senescence [14].
In vitro studies provide further evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence transition. Long-term quiescent human fibroblasts in culture (100–150 days) accumulate DNA
damage and transit into senescence [15]. Our recent work showed that quiescent rat
embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) with impaired lysosomal autophagy can directly enter a
senescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest, β-galactosidase activity,
and cellular hypertrophy [16]. These in vitro results strengthen the findings of in vivo
studies by showing that cells maintained in quiescent conditions throughout the experiments eventually transitioned to senescence, bypassing cell proliferation (which can be
difficult to track in vivo, e.g., throughout the entire geriatric phase). Together, these in vivo
and in vitro studies provide compelling evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence
transition, resulting in quiescence-origin senescence.
2.2. Quiescence Deepening into Senescence: A Continuum Model
The observation that cells can transition from quiescence to senescence aligns with the
concept that quiescence is not a uniform state but rather a spectrum of dormant depths.
Specifically, deeper quiescent cells are more resistant to cell cycle re-entry, and they resume
proliferation less frequently or with a longer delay than shallower quiescent cells given the
same growth stimulation [8,19–35]. Cells in deep quiescence generally exhibit decreased
transcription, reduced RNA and protein levels, and increased chromatin condensation
compared to cells in shallow quiescence [22,36–38]. Recent studies have further revealed the
changes in the cellular profiles of gene expression, epigenetic modification, and metabolism
that occur during the process of quiescence deepening [8,16,39–41]. It is important to note
that deep quiescent cells, by definition, still retain the potential for cell cycle re-entry and
can resume proliferation given a sufficiently strong and sustained growth stimulus, which
is distinct from senescent cells.
Quiescence deepening has been observed under extended quiescence in culture or
along the aging process in vivo across mammalian cell types and tissues [8,19–33] as well

as in yeast [34] and C. elegans [35]. Consistent with quiescence depth being a continuum,
subpopulations of quiescent muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, upon tissue
injury or in response to systemic factors, can move to shallower (primed or GAlert ) quiescence, bearing a closer resemblance to active cells [42–45]. Further extending the cell
dormancy state continuum, senescent cells also exhibit varying “depths” with different
cellular characteristics [46–48].
Our recent work directly links quiescence deepening to senescence entry. We found
that while enhancing lysosomal autophagy activity pushes REFs toward shallow quiescence,
decreasing lysosomal autophagy drives REFs into progressively deeper quiescence [16].
When lysosomal autophagy is severely hampered (with chloroquine treatment, for example), deep quiescent (yet still reversible) cells transition into irreversible senescence [16].
This suggests that lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” that continuously adjusts cellular dormancy depth from shallow quiescence to deep quiescence and
finally to senescence [16,41]. Furthermore, the transcriptomic profile changes during quiescence deepening in REFs resemble those of senescence entry with similar expression
changes in “senescence core signature” genes [16,49]. A gene signature derived from
quiescence deepening in REFs, the quiescence depth score (QDS), can correctly predict a
wide array of sen

1 cyclins
and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) being the most prominent [28].
The Rb–E2F switch is the first bistable switch that cells encounter during the transition
from quiescence to proliferation in response to mitogens, and it connects to downstream
bistable switches and checkpoints regulating S phase entry [67,68]. Given that the Rb–E2F
pathway interacts with other quiescence regulatory pathways (e.g., Notch–Hes1, p53–p21,
PI3K–Akt, DNA damage response, LKB1–AMPK, and microRNA) [10,27,63], we propose
that the Rb–E2F switch serves as a core hub that integrates cellular signals to quantitatively
determine the growth stimulation level required for the all-or-none cell cycle re-entry. In
parallel, other cellular pathways impinge on the Rb–E2F switch and modulate its switch
threshold. This modulatory effect may occur through crosstalk with various gene nodes in
the Rb–E2F switch network, most effectively by affecting G1 cyclin and CDK activities in
the cell [13,28,69]. Higher thresholds lead to deeper quiescence and, eventually, senescence
when physiological growth signals can no longer overcome the threshold [27,41]. Therefore,
the difference between deep quiescence and senescence lies primarily in the magnitude of
the Rb–E2F switch threshold rather than in fundamentally distinct cellular characteristics,
aligning with the quiescence–senescence continuum model.
The lysosomal–autophagy axis discussed above driving quiescence-to-senescence
transition in MuSCs directly increases the Rb–E2F switch threshold (by activating p16 that
inhibits CDK activity) [13,18]. Similarly, increasing the Rb–E2F switch threshold has been
reported to drive deep quiescence in MuSCs via fasting-induced ketone body signaling (by
increasing p21 that inhibits CDK) [69]. This threshold mechanism predicts a potential way
to reverse the “irreversible” senescence by reducing the Rb–E2F switch threshold. Indeed,
studies have shown that senescent cells can be reactivated as such, e.g., by inactivating Rb,
p53–p21, or p16 activities [70–75] or by the forced G1 cyclin upregulation [76].
3.3. Remaining Unknowns and the Heterogeneity in Quiescence-Origin Senescence
Several key areas remain to be explored. The role of mTOR signaling, for instance,
presents an intriguing paradox. mTOR is a major driver of proliferation-origin senescence,
underlying the process of geroconversion—a process in which mTOR-driven cell growth
continues aberrantly after the cell cycle is blocked (e.g., by CDK inhibitors p21CIP1/Waf1 and
p16INK4a ) [11,77]. In quiescence, mTOR is inactive and cells lack sustained growth, which
has been proposed as a mechanism to protect quiescent cells against senescence [11,77]. This
questions the involvement of mTOR in quiescence deepening and the quiescence-origin
senescence, which aligns with the fact that mTOR activity is linked to shallow quiescence
(GAlert ) [42], not quiescence deepening. Therefore, the quiescence-origin senescence appears
different from proliferation-origin senescence from the aspect of mTOR and geroconversion
(Figure 1).

reenter the cell cycle. This result is consistent with our earlier
study with targeted perturbations (although the relative degree
of required increases in serum concentration and time may vary
depending on the specific quiescence-deepening factors) (14).
Here we used at least 1 consistent indicator, the minimum serum
concentration required for cell cycle reentry, to measure quiescence depth throughout this study.
We applied 2 lysosomal inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and
chloroquine (CQ), that prevent lysosomal acidification (36). A
short exposure (6 h) to either drug was sufficient to inhibit lysosomal function in REF cells, evident by the impaired proteolytic degradation within the lysosomal compartment (SI
Appendix, Fig. S5A). When quiescent cells were treated with
either of these 2 lysosomal inhibitors, increasingly higher serum
concentrations were required to activate cells to reenter the cell
cycle, in a drug dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B–D; red arrow
points to serum concentration for activating ∼50% of cells, judged
based on EdU incorporation, E2f-GFP reporter, and propidium
iodide [PI] staining, respectively). Correspondingly, at a given
serum concentration (e.g., 4% serum), a decreasing percentage of
cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU+) with an increasing
dose of either lysosomal inhibitor, Baf or CQ (Fig. 4B). The lysosomal inhibition-caused quiescence deepening occurred regardless of the preceding quiescence depth before drug treatment:
As shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S5B, a higher serum concentration
was required to activate drug-treated (blue curve) than nontreated
(red curve) cells at all test conditions (serum-starvation days).
Consistently, cells took longer time to reenter the cell cycle
under the treatments of lysosomal inhibitors Baf and CQ. For
example, with either the treatment of 5 μM CQ or control
(Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, DPBS), although nearly
all cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU+) by the 24th
