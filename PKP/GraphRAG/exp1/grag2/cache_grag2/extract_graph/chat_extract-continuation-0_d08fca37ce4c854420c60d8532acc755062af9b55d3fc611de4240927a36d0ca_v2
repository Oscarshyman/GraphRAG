The Quiescence–Senescence Continuum: A Framework for Understanding\nQuiescence-Origin Senescence\n2.1. Direct Transition from Quiescence to Senescence\nMounting evidence in the past decade demonstrates a direct transition to senescence in\nquiescent cells under stress or with aging. One of the first reports of this phenomenon was\nin geriatric mice, where quiescent satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MuSCs) lose regenerative\ncapacity and become irreversibly arrested [13]. The same observation was confirmed in\ngeriatric human muscle, suggesting a conserved mechanism contributing to age-related\ndecline in muscle regenerative capacity [13]. The quiescence-to-senescence transition in\ngeriatric MuSCs was linked to the epigenetic derepression of p16INK4a , which is a key\nregulator of senescence [13].\nFurther research revealed that p16INK4a derepression in geriatric MuSCs was triggered\nby accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from failed autophagy [18]. Restoring autophagy prevents the transition to senescence in quiescent MuSCs [18]. Similarly,\nin quiescent human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), stress-induced ROS\naccumulation can elevate the p16INK4a level and drive the transition to senescence [14].\nIn vitro studies provide further evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence transition. Long-term quiescent human fibroblasts in culture (100–150 days) accumulate DNA\ndamage and transit into senescence [15]. Our recent work showed that quiescent rat\nembryonic fibroblasts (REFs) with impaired lysosomal autophagy can directly enter a\nsenescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest, β-galactosidase activity,\nand cellular hypertrophy [16]. These in vitro results strengthen the findings of in vivo\nstudies by showing that cells maintained in quiescent conditions throughout the experiments eventually transitioned to senescence, bypassing cell proliferation (which can be\ndifficult to track in vivo, e.g., throughout the entire geriatric phase). Together, these in vivo\nand in vitro studies provide compelling evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition, resulting in quiescence-origin senescence.\n2.2. Quiescence Deepening into Senescence: A Continuum Model\nThe observation that cells can transition from quiescence to senescence aligns with the\nconcept that quiescence is not a uniform state but rather a spectrum of dormant depths.\nSpecifically, deeper quiescent cells are more resistant to cell cycle re-entry, and they resume\nproliferation less frequently or with a longer delay than shallower quiescent cells given the\nsame growth stimulation [8,19–35]. Cells in deep quiescence generally exhibit decreased\ntranscription, reduced RNA and protein levels, and increased chromatin condensation\ncompared to cells in shallow quiescence [22,36–38]. Recent studies have further revealed the\nchanges in the cellular profiles of gene expression, epigenetic modification, and metabolism\nthat occur during the process of quiescence deepening [8,16,39–41]. It is important to note\nthat deep quiescent cells, by definition, still retain the potential for cell cycle re-entry and\ncan resume proliferation given a sufficiently strong and sustained growth stimulus, which\nis distinct from senescent cells.\nQuiescence deepening has been observed under extended quiescence in culture or\nalong the aging process in vivo across mammalian cell types and tissues [8,19–33] as well\n\n\fBiomedicines 2024, 12, 1837\n\n3 of 8\n\nas in yeast [34] and C. elegans [35]. Consistent with quiescence depth being a continuum,\nsubpopulations of quiescent muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, upon tissue\ninjury or in response to systemic factors, can move to shallower (primed or GAlert ) quiescence, bearing a closer resemblance to active cells [42–45]. Further extending the cell\ndormancy state continuum, senescent cells also exhibit varying “depths” with different\ncellular characteristics [46–48].\nOur recent work directly links quiescence deepening to senescence entry. We found\nthat while enhancing lysosomal autophagy activity pushes REFs toward shallow quiescence,\ndecreasing lysosomal autophagy drives REFs into progressively deeper quiescence [16].\nWhen lysosomal autophagy is severely hampered (with chloroquine treatment, for example), deep quiescent (yet still reversible) cells transition into irreversible senescence [16].\nThis suggests that lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” that continuously adjusts cellular dormancy depth from shallow quiescence to deep quiescence and\nfinally to senescence [16,41]. Furthermore, the transcriptomic profile changes during quiescence deepening in REFs resemble those of senescence entry with similar expression\nchanges in “senescence core signature” genes [16,49]. A gene signature derived from\nquiescence deepening in REFs, the quiescence depth score (QDS), can correctly predict a\nwide array of sen\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are metabolically inactive but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescence is a state where cells lose the ability to divide and grow, often as a response to stress or aging, leading to irreversible cell cycle arrest.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>GENE<|>P16INK4A is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle and is a key regulator of senescence, often upregulated in senescent cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>MOLECULAR MECHANISM<|>Reactive oxygen species are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen that can cause cellular damage and are implicated in the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>MOLECULAR MECHANISM<|>Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>PHENOTYPE<|>Geriatric mice exhibit age-related decline in regenerative capacity, often transitioning from quiescent to senescent states under stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS (HSPCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Hematopoietic stem progenitor cells are a type of stem cell that can differentiate into various blood cells and can transition to senescence under stress conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENT MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Quiescent muscle stem cells are dormant cells that can regenerate muscle tissue but may lose this capacity and enter senescence with aging or stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>MOLECULAR MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a process that degrades cellular components and is essential for preventing the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>GENE<|>The quiescence depth score is a gene signature that predicts the transition from quiescence to senescence based on transcriptomic changes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence can transition into senescence under stress or aging conditions, indicating a direct relationship between the two states.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P16INK4A<|>SENESCENCE<|>P16INK4A is a key regulator that promotes senescence when derepressed in quiescent cells.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>SENESCENCE<|>Accumulation of ROS can trigger the transition from quiescence to senescence, linking oxidative stress to cellular aging.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>SENESCENCE<|>Restoring autophagy can prevent the transition to senescence, highlighting its protective role against cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>QUIESCENT MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>Geriatric mice show that quiescent muscle stem cells lose regenerative capacity and enter senescence with aging.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS (HSPCs)<|>SENESCENCE<|>HSPCs can transition to senescence due to stress-induced ROS accumulation, linking them to the senescence process.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENT MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescent MuSCs can transition to senescence, indicating a relationship between these cell types and the senescence process.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal autophagy activity influences the depth of quiescence, affecting the transition to senescence.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>SENESCENCE<|>The QDS can predict the transition from quiescence to senescence based on gene expression changes.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [cell type, biological process, molecular mechanism, disease, intervention strategy, gene, pathway, phenotype]\ntext:\n1 cyclins\nand cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) being the most prominent [28].\nThe Rb–E2F switch is the first bistable switch that cells encounter during the transition\nfrom quiescence to proliferation in response to mitogens, and it connects to downstream\nbistable switches and checkpoints regulating S phase entry [67,68]. Given that the Rb–E2F\npathway interacts with other quiescence regulatory pathways (e.g., Notch–Hes1, p53–p21,\nPI3K–Akt, DNA damage response, LKB1–AMPK, and microRNA) [10,27,63], we propose\nthat the Rb–E2F switch serves as a core hub that integrates cellular signals to quantitatively\ndetermine the growth stimulation level required for the all-or-none cell cycle re-entry. In\nparallel, other cellular pathways impinge on the Rb–E2F switch and modulate its switch\nthreshold. This modulatory effect may occur through crosstalk with various gene nodes in\nthe Rb–E2F switch network, most effectively by affecting G1 cyclin and CDK activities in\nthe cell [13,28,69]. Higher thresholds lead to deeper quiescence and, eventually, senescence\nwhen physiological growth signals can no longer overcome the threshold [27,41]. Therefore,\nthe difference between deep quiescence and senescence lies primarily in the magnitude of\nthe Rb–E2F switch threshold rather than in fundamentally distinct cellular characteristics,\naligning with the quiescence–senescence continuum model.\nThe lysosomal–autophagy axis discussed above driving quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition in MuSCs directly increases the Rb–E2F switch threshold (by activating p16 that\ninhibits CDK activity) [13,18]. Similarly, increasing the Rb–E2F switch threshold has been\nreported to drive deep quiescence in MuSCs via fasting-induced ketone body signaling (by\nincreasing p21 that inhibits CDK) [69]. This threshold mechanism predicts a potential way\nto reverse the “irreversible” senescence by reducing the Rb–E2F switch threshold. Indeed,\nstudies have shown that senescent cells can be reactivated as such, e.g., by inactivating Rb,\np53–p21, or p16 activities [70–75] or by the forced G1 cyclin upregulation [76].\n3.3. Remaining Unknowns and the Heterogeneity in Quiescence-Origin Senescence\nSeveral key areas remain to be explored. The role of mTOR signaling, for instance,\npresents an intriguing paradox. mTOR is a major driver of proliferation-origin senescence,\nunderlying the process of geroconversion—a process in which mTOR-driven cell growth\ncontinues aberrantly after the cell cycle is blocked (e.g., by CDK inhibitors p21CIP1/Waf1 and\np16INK4a ) [11,77]. In quiescence, mTOR is inactive and cells lack sustained growth, which\nhas been proposed as a mechanism to protect quiescent cells against senescence [11,77]. This\nquestions the involvement of mTOR in quiescence deepening and the quiescence-origin\nsenescence, which aligns with the fact that mTOR activity is linked to shallow quiescence\n(GAlert ) [42], not quiescence deepening. Therefore, the quiescence-origin senescence appears\ndifferent from proliferation-origin senescence from the aspect of mTOR and geroconversion\n(Figure 1).\n\n\fBiomedicines 2024, 12, 1837\n\nBiomedicines 2024, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n6 of 9\n\n5 of 8\n\nFigure\n1.

When we applied the quiescence-depth gene signature\nof REF cells to the RNA-seq data corresponding to NSCs before\nand after neural injury, we obtained quiescence depth scores\n(QDS) from the linear regression model (see Materials and\nMethods for details) to indicate the relative quiescence depth of\nNSCs. We found that the QDS of primed NSCs after injury was\nsignificantly smaller (i.e., shallower quiescence) than that of\ndormant NSCs before injury (Fig. 7A). This result suggests that\nthe quiescence-depth signature of REF cells in vitro can predict\nthe relative quiescence depth of NSCs in vivo, indicating that this\ngene signature may reflect shared quiescence regulatory mechanisms across different cell types.\nTo test case S, we analyzed RNA-seq datasets associated with\ncellular senescence and aging by applying the QDS model with\nthe quiescence-depth gene signature of REF cells. Strikingly, we\nfound that QDS correctly predicted cellular senescence and aging in a wide array of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo\n(22, 23) (Fig. 7 B–D). In all 6 cell lines (BJ, IMR-90, WI-38,\nHFF, MRC-5, and MDAH041) studied under replicative senescence and in all 3 conditions (Adriamycin, 5-aza, and H2O2)\nstudied under stress-induced senescence, QDS was significantly\n\n\fDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA LIBRARY on October 25, 2024 from IP address 128.196.199.13.\n\nand terminal differentiation (15, 16, 18). The present study shows\nthat instead of a simple OFF–ON switch, lysosomes function as a\ndimmer switch to continuously modulate quiescence depth (Fig.\n6H) and proliferative capacity of quiescent cells.\nOur study suggests that as cells move deeper in quiescence,\nlysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass increase, but lysosomal function and lysosome destruction decrease. Decreased\nlysosome destruction via autophagy/lysophagy contributes to an\nincreased lysosomal mass and likely an accumulation of damaged\nlysosomes, which in turn contributes to a decreased lysosomal–\nautophagy function. Decreased lysosome destruction alone,\nhowever, does not fully explain the increased lysosomal mass\n(both lysoTracker intensity of lysosome number) observed in\ndeep quiescent cells (Fig. 2 G and H), as blocking lysosome\ndestruction increased LysoTracker intensity but not the number\nof lysosomes in REF cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S4); similarly, it was\nreported previously that lysosomal number did not change or\neven mildly decreased in autophagy-impaired fibroblasts with\nAtg4B and Atg7 mutations (46). The other contributing factor of\nincreased lysosomal mass in deep quiescence appears to be lysosomal biogenesis: The expression of Mitf, a master regulator of\nlysosomal biogenesis, significantly increased the lysosomal\nnumber (SI Appendix, Fig. S6E) in quiescent REF cells. Consistently, we found that applying small chemical inhibitors to\nrepress Mcoln1 (also known as TRPML1) that is crucial for lysosome biogenesis (47)\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUESCENCE-DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>GENE<|>The quiescence-depth score (QDS) is a predictive model derived from gene signatures that indicates the relative depth of quiescence in various cell types, reflecting shared regulatory mechanisms across different cellular contexts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS (HSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Hematopoietic stem cells are multipotent stem cells that give rise to all blood cell types and can exhibit varying quiescence states depending on age and environmental factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DORMANT NEURAL STEM CELLS (NSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Dormant neural stem cells are quiescent cells in the nervous system that can transition to a more active state in response to injury or other stimuli.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIMED NEURAL STEM CELLS (NSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Primed neural stem cells are a shallower quiescent state of NSCs that can be activated more readily than dormant NSCs, particularly after neural injury.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to stress or damage, contributing to aging and various age-related diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL BIOGENESIS<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosomal biogenesis is the process by which new lysosomes are formed within the cell, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>MOLECULAR MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal function involves the degradation and recycling of cellular components, essential for cellular health and response to stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL DESTRUCTION<|>MOLECULAR MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal destruction refers to the breakdown of damaged lysosomes, which is important for maintaining lysosomal function and preventing cellular damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADRIAMYCIN<|>INTERVENTION STRATEGY<|>Adriamycin is a chemotherapeutic agent that can induce stress-induced senescence in cells, often used in cancer treatment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5-AZA-2-DEOXYCYTIDINE (5-AZA)<|>INTERVENTION STRATEGY<|>5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine is a DNA demethylation agent that can induce cellular stress and senescence, affecting gene expression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H2O2)<|>INTERVENTION STRATEGY<|>Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that can induce oxidative stress, leading to cellular senescence and damage.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUESCENCE-DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS (HSCs)<|>The QDS can predict the quiescence depth of HSCs, indicating how their quiescence state changes with age and environmental factors.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUESCENCE-DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>DORMANT NEURAL STEM CELLS (NSCs)<|>The QDS can reflect the quiescence depth of dormant NSCs, suggesting shared regulatory mechanisms with other cell types.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DORMANT NEURAL STEM CELLS (NSCs)<|>PRIMED NEURAL STEM CELLS (NSCs)<|>Dormant NSCs transition to primed NSCs upon neural injury, indicating a relationship between these two states of neural stem cells.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS (HSCs)<|>HSCs can undergo senescence in response to stress, affecting their regenerative capacity and function.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL BIOGENESIS<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>Lysosomal biogenesis is essential for maintaining lysosomal function, as it ensures the production of new lysosomes for cellular degradation processes.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL DESTRUCTION<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>Lysosomal destruction is a critical aspect of lysosomal function, as it helps remove damaged lysosomes and maintain cellular health.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADRIAMYCIN<|>SENESCENCE<|>Adriamycin induces stress that can lead to cellular senescence, linking this intervention strategy to the senescence process.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>5-AZA-2-DEOXYCYTIDINE (5-AZA)<|>SENESCENCE<|>5-Aza can induce stress-induced senescence in cells, demonstrating its role in promoting cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H2O2)<|>SENESCENCE<|>H2O2 induces oxidative stress that can trigger senescence, linking this intervention strategy to the aging process.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
