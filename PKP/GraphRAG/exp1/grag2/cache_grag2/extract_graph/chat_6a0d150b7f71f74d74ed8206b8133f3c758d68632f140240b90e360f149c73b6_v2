The Quiescence–Senescence Continuum: A Framework for Understanding\nQuiescence-Origin Senescence\n2.1. Direct Transition from Quiescence to Senescence\nMounting evidence in the past decade demonstrates a direct transition to senescence in\nquiescent cells under stress or with aging. One of the first reports of this phenomenon was\nin geriatric mice, where quiescent satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MuSCs) lose regenerative\ncapacity and become irreversibly arrested [13]. The same observation was confirmed in\ngeriatric human muscle, suggesting a conserved mechanism contributing to age-related\ndecline in muscle regenerative capacity [13]. The quiescence-to-senescence transition in\ngeriatric MuSCs was linked to the epigenetic derepression of p16INK4a , which is a key\nregulator of senescence [13].\nFurther research revealed that p16INK4a derepression in geriatric MuSCs was triggered\nby accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from failed autophagy [18]. Restoring autophagy prevents the transition to senescence in quiescent MuSCs [18]. Similarly,\nin quiescent human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), stress-induced ROS\naccumulation can elevate the p16INK4a level and drive the transition to senescence [14].\nIn vitro studies provide further evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence transition. Long-term quiescent human fibroblasts in culture (100–150 days) accumulate DNA\ndamage and transit into senescence [15]. Our recent work showed that quiescent rat\nembryonic fibroblasts (REFs) with impaired lysosomal autophagy can directly enter a\nsenescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest, β-galactosidase activity,\nand cellular hypertrophy [16]. These in vitro results strengthen the findings of in vivo\nstudies by showing that cells maintained in quiescent conditions throughout the experiments eventually transitioned to senescence, bypassing cell proliferation (which can be\ndifficult to track in vivo, e.g., throughout the entire geriatric phase). Together, these in vivo\nand in vitro studies provide compelling evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition, resulting in quiescence-origin senescence.\n2.2. Quiescence Deepening into Senescence: A Continuum Model\nThe observation that cells can transition from quiescence to senescence aligns with the\nconcept that quiescence is not a uniform state but rather a spectrum of dormant depths.\nSpecifically, deeper quiescent cells are more resistant to cell cycle re-entry, and they resume\nproliferation less frequently or with a longer delay than shallower quiescent cells given the\nsame growth stimulation [8,19–35]. Cells in deep quiescence generally exhibit decreased\ntranscription, reduced RNA and protein levels, and increased chromatin condensation\ncompared to cells in shallow quiescence [22,36–38]. Recent studies have further revealed the\nchanges in the cellular profiles of gene expression, epigenetic modification, and metabolism\nthat occur during the process of quiescence deepening [8,16,39–41]. It is important to note\nthat deep quiescent cells, by definition, still retain the potential for cell cycle re-entry and\ncan resume proliferation given a sufficiently strong and sustained growth stimulus, which\nis distinct from senescent cells.\nQuiescence deepening has been observed under extended quiescence in culture or\nalong the aging process in vivo across mammalian cell types and tissues [8,19–33] as well\n\n\fBiomedicines 2024, 12, 1837\n\n3 of 8\n\nas in yeast [34] and C. elegans [35]. Consistent with quiescence depth being a continuum,\nsubpopulations of quiescent muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, upon tissue\ninjury or in response to systemic factors, can move to shallower (primed or GAlert ) quiescence, bearing a closer resemblance to active cells [42–45]. Further extending the cell\ndormancy state continuum, senescent cells also exhibit varying “depths” with different\ncellular characteristics [46–48].\nOur recent work directly links quiescence deepening to senescence entry. We found\nthat while enhancing lysosomal autophagy activity pushes REFs toward shallow quiescence,\ndecreasing lysosomal autophagy drives REFs into progressively deeper quiescence [16].\nWhen lysosomal autophagy is severely hampered (with chloroquine treatment, for example), deep quiescent (yet still reversible) cells transition into irreversible senescence [16].\nThis suggests that lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” that continuously adjusts cellular dormancy depth from shallow quiescence to deep quiescence and\nfinally to senescence [16,41]. Furthermore, the transcriptomic profile changes during quiescence deepening in REFs resemble those of senescence entry with similar expression\nchanges in “senescence core signature” genes [16,49]. A gene signature derived from\nquiescence deepening in REFs, the quiescence depth score (QDS), can correctly predict a\nwide array of sen\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are metabolically inactive but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescence is a state where cells lose the ability to divide and grow, often as a response to stress or aging, leading to irreversible cell cycle arrest.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>GENE<|>P16INK4A is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle and is a key regulator of senescence, often upregulated in senescent cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>MOLECULAR MECHANISM<|>Reactive oxygen species are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen that can cause cellular damage and are implicated in the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>MOLECULAR MECHANISM<|>Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>PHENOTYPE<|>Geriatric mice exhibit age-related decline in regenerative capacity, often transitioning from quiescent to senescent states under stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS (HSPCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Hematopoietic stem progenitor cells are a type of stem cell that can differentiate into various blood cells and can transition to senescence under stress conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENT MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Quiescent muscle stem cells are dormant cells that can regenerate muscle tissue but may lose this capacity and enter senescence with aging or stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>MOLECULAR MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a process that degrades cellular components and is essential for preventing the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>GENE<|>The quiescence depth score is a gene signature that predicts the transition from quiescence to senescence based on transcriptomic changes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence can transition into senescence under stress or aging conditions, indicating a direct relationship between the two states.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P16INK4A<|>SENESCENCE<|>P16INK4A is a key regulator that promotes senescence when derepressed in quiescent cells.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>SENESCENCE<|>Accumulation of ROS can trigger the transition from quiescence to senescence, linking oxidative stress to cellular aging.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>SENESCENCE<|>Restoring autophagy can prevent the transition to senescence, highlighting its protective role against cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>QUIESCENT MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>Geriatric mice show that quiescent muscle stem cells lose regenerative capacity and enter senescence with aging.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS (HSPCs)<|>SENESCENCE<|>HSPCs can transition to senescence due to stress-induced ROS accumulation, linking them to the senescence process.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENT MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescent MuSCs can transition to senescence, indicating a relationship between these cell types and the senescence process.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal autophagy activity influences the depth of quiescence, affecting the transition to senescence.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>SENESCENCE<|>The QDS can predict the transition from quiescence to senescence based on gene expression changes.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [cell type, biological process, molecular mechanism, disease, intervention strategy, gene, pathway, phenotype]\ntext:\n1 cyclins\nand cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) being the most prominent [28].\nThe Rb–E2F switch is the first bistable switch that cells encounter during the transition\nfrom quiescence to proliferation in response to mitogens, and it connects to downstream\nbistable switches and checkpoints regulating S phase entry [67,68]. Given that the Rb–E2F\npathway interacts with other quiescence regulatory pathways (e.g., Notch–Hes1, p53–p21,\nPI3K–Akt, DNA damage response, LKB1–AMPK, and microRNA) [10,27,63], we propose\nthat the Rb–E2F switch serves as a core hub that integrates cellular signals to quantitatively\ndetermine the growth stimulation level required for the all-or-none cell cycle re-entry. In\nparallel, other cellular pathways impinge on the Rb–E2F switch and modulate its switch\nthreshold. This modulatory effect may occur through crosstalk with various gene nodes in\nthe Rb–E2F switch network, most effectively by affecting G1 cyclin and CDK activities in\nthe cell [13,28,69]. Higher thresholds lead to deeper quiescence and, eventually, senescence\nwhen physiological growth signals can no longer overcome the threshold [27,41]. Therefore,\nthe difference between deep quiescence and senescence lies primarily in the magnitude of\nthe Rb–E2F switch threshold rather than in fundamentally distinct cellular characteristics,\naligning with the quiescence–senescence continuum model.\nThe lysosomal–autophagy axis discussed above driving quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition in MuSCs directly increases the Rb–E2F switch threshold (by activating p16 that\ninhibits CDK activity) [13,18]. Similarly, increasing the Rb–E2F switch threshold has been\nreported to drive deep quiescence in MuSCs via fasting-induced ketone body signaling (by\nincreasing p21 that inhibits CDK) [69]. This threshold mechanism predicts a potential way\nto reverse the “irreversible” senescence by reducing the Rb–E2F switch threshold. Indeed,\nstudies have shown that senescent cells can be reactivated as such, e.g., by inactivating Rb,\np53–p21, or p16 activities [70–75] or by the forced G1 cyclin upregulation [76].\n3.3. Remaining Unknowns and the Heterogeneity in Quiescence-Origin Senescence\nSeveral key areas remain to be explored. The role of mTOR signaling, for instance,\npresents an intriguing paradox. mTOR is a major driver of proliferation-origin senescence,\nunderlying the process of geroconversion—a process in which mTOR-driven cell growth\ncontinues aberrantly after the cell cycle is blocked (e.g., by CDK inhibitors p21CIP1/Waf1 and\np16INK4a ) [11,77]. In quiescence, mTOR is inactive and cells lack sustained growth, which\nhas been proposed as a mechanism to protect quiescent cells against senescence [11,77]. This\nquestions the involvement of mTOR in quiescence deepening and the quiescence-origin\nsenescence, which aligns with the fact that mTOR activity is linked to shallow quiescence\n(GAlert ) [42], not quiescence deepening. Therefore, the quiescence-origin senescence appears\ndifferent from proliferation-origin senescence from the aspect of mTOR and geroconversion\n(Figure 1).\n\n\fBiomedicines 2024, 12, 1837\n\nBiomedicines 2024, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n6 of 9\n\n5 of 8\n\nFigure\n1.

One may wonder, however, whether\nthis phenotype was caused by the gradual depletion of nutrients\nin the static culture medium in vitro, which may behave\ndifferently in vivo under an interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow replenishing\nnutrients. In the microﬂuidic platform under a constant ﬂuid ﬂow\n(either 5 or 20 μl/h) during serum starvation, we found cells that\nremained quiescent for a longer period of time (8 days) entered a\ndeeper quiescent state and became less likely to exit: they had a\nsmaller E2f-On% upon a given serum stimulation than those that\nremained quiescent for a shorter time (4 days, Figure 2).\nTogether, these results showed that cellular behaviors in 1)\nserum signal-dependant quiescence entry and exit and 2)\nquiescence deepening over time are consistent regardless\n\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nwhether cells are in microﬂuidic devices exposed to\nextracellular ﬂuid ﬂows or in conventional static-medium\ncultures.\n\nFast Extracellular Fluid Flow Results in\nShallow Quiescence\nTo examine whether and how extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow may affect\ncellular quiescence depth, we compared the cells induced to\nquiescence by serum starvation under different medium ﬂow\nrates but otherwise in the same conditions. Speciﬁcally, cells in\nmicroﬂuidic devices were cultured in serum-starvation medium\n(0.02% serum) for 4 days under an extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow (0, 5, or\n20 μl/h); serum-starvation medium was then replaced by serumstimulation medium (1–4% serum) using a pipette—this medium\nchange procedure in each microﬂuidic device was completed\nwithin 1 min (compared to otherwise more than 20 and 5 h under\na pump-driven slow ﬂow of 5 and 20 μl/h, respectively); cells were\nthen cultured in static medium during serum stimulation. This\nidentical serum-stimulation condition was applied in this study\n(see Methods for details), so that the subsequent cell cycle reenter\n\n5\n\nFebruary 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 792719\n\n\fLiu et al.\n\nExtracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescence\n\nFIGURE 3 | Higher extracellular medium ﬂow rates lead to shallower quiescence. REF/E23 cells seeded in microﬂuidic devices were induced to and maintained in\nquiescence by culturing them in serum-starvation medium for 4 days under various medium ﬂow rates as indicated. Cells were then stimulated with serum at the\nindicated concentrations for 26 h, and the E2f-GFP signals were measured using ﬂow cytometry. (A) The E2f-GFP histograms. Numbers in red indicate the average\npercentages of cells with E2f-GFP at the “On” state (see Supplementary Figure S1D for examples) based on duplicate samples (black and grey histograms).

The cells were\nthen stimulated with 2% or 4% serum for 26 h, and the fraction of\ncells that exited quiescence (E2f-On%) was measured. As shown\nin Figures 4A,B, E2f-On% increased with increasing dextran\nconcentration in the serum-starvation medium under either 5 or\n20 μl/h ﬂow rate. By contrast, cells cultured in static serumstarvation medium containing the same higher dextran\nconcentration entered deeper rather than shallower quiescence\n(Supplementary Figure S2; see Discussion). These results suggest\nthat the dextran-induced shallow quiescence in the presence of\nextracellular ﬂuid ﬂow was primarily due to the viscositydependent shear stress (instead of other dextran-associated\neffects\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6a0d150b7f71f74d74ed8206b8133f3c758d68632f140240b90e360f149c73b6_v2"}
