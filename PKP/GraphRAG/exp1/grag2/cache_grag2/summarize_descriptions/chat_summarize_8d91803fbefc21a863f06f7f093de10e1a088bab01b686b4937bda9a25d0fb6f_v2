Continuous extracellular factor replacement has been shown to induce a shallower state of quiescence compared to conditions lacking such replacement, which significantly impacts cell activation. Furthermore, this replacement not only aids in promoting the exit from quiescence but also plays a crucial role in regulating the depth of quiescence itself. This modulation indicates that extracellular factors are essential in influencing both cellular activation and dormancy, highlighting their importance in the overall process of cellular proliferation and quiescence management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749161963, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 427, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
