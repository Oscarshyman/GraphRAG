These cells are particularly valuable for studying the effects of external stimuli, such as serum concentration and fluid flow, on cellular behavior. The REF/E23 cell line is engineered to express a destabilized GFP reporter, which is regulated by the E2f1 promoter, allowing researchers to monitor cellular processes in real-time.
