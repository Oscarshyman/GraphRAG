This force plays a significant role in influencing cell behavior and function, particularly in microfluidic environments. It affects various aspects of cellular dynamics, including viability, morphology, and signaling pathways related to quiescence and proliferation. Specifically, shear stress can impact cellular responses and the depth of quiescence, ultimately influencing the exit from this state. Understanding shear stress is crucial for comprehending how cells interact with their fluidic surroundings and how these interactions can affect their overall behavior and functionality.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749161957, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 350, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
