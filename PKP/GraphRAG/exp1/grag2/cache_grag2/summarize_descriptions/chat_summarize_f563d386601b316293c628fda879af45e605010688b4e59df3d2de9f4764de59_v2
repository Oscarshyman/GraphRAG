It is utilized to manipulate the viscosity of culture media, which in turn affects cellular behavior during both quiescence and stimulation. Additionally, dextran serves to modulate osmotic pressure, influencing cellular responses particularly during serum starvation and stimulation. Its ability to modify the viscosity of solutions is crucial in biological experiments, as it impacts fluid dynamics in microchannels, thereby facilitating various experimental setups and outcomes. Overall, dextran is an essential tool in the study of cellular dynamics and responses in controlled environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749165257, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 428, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
