The process establishes a direct link between nutrient deprivation and the onset of cellular dormancy, highlighting serum starvation as a key method for promoting quiescence in various cellular contexts. Through these mechanisms, serum starvation plays a crucial role in regulating cellular behavior and responses to environmental stressors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749161961, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 102, "prompt_tokens": 376, "total_tokens": 478, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
