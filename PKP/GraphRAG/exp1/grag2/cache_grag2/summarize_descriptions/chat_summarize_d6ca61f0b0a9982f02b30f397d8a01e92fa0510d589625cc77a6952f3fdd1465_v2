This phenomenon indicates that mechanical shear stress plays a crucial role in promoting the exit from quiescence, thereby affecting cellular behavior in response to fluid dynamics. Specifically, the shear stress generated by extracellular fluid flow alters cellular responses to growth signals, driving cells towards a state of shallow quiescence. Overall, the interplay between mechanical shear stress and quiescence highlights the importance of physical forces in regulating cellular states and behaviors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749161963, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
