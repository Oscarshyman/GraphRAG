This flow exerts shear stress on cells, significantly influencing their behavior, including states of quiescence and proliferation. It plays a crucial role in cellular activities such as morphology, migration, growth, and differentiation by providing essential nutrients and mechanical stimuli. The movement of extracellular fluid not only affects cellular responses to growth signals but also impacts the transition from quiescent to active states, thereby promoting quiescence exit. Additionally, it contributes to tissue repair by influencing cellular adhesion and metabolic activity. Overall, extracellular fluid flow is a vital factor in regulating cellular dynamics and maintaining tissue homeostasis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749161957, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 463, "total_tokens": 601, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
