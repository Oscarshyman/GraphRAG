It integrates a variety of signals from the cellular environment, including both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, to determine the appropriate timing for cell cycle re-entry. This switch plays a vital role in responding to growth signals, ensuring that cells can effectively transition from a dormant state to active division when conditions are favorable.
