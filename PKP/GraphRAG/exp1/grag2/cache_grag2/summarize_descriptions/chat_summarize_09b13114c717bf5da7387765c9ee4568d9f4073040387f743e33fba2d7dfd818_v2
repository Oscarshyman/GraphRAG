It plays a crucial role in determining the quiescence of cells, their ability to reenter the cell cycle, and the activation of various signaling pathways. In fluid environments, shear stress affects not only the quiescence depth of cells but also their overall responses and functions, particularly in microfluidic systems. This mechanical force is essential for understanding how cells interact with their environment and can impact processes such as proliferation and cellular activation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749165257, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 382, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
