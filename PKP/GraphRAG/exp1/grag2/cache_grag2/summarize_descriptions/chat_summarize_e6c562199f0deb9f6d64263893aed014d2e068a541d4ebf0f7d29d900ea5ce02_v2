It is primarily utilized to manipulate the viscosity of culture media, which in turn affects various cellular behaviors, including quiescence and proliferation. Additionally, dextran serves to modulate osmotic pressure, influencing cellular responses during conditions such as serum starvation and stimulation. Its ability to modify the viscosity of solutions is crucial in biological experiments, as it impacts shear stress and fluid dynamics within microchannels. Overall, dextran is an essential tool in the study of cellular interactions and responses in various experimental settings.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1749161958, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_34a54ae93c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 310, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
