It responds to growth signals and integrates both intrinsic and extrinsic factors from the cellular environment to determine the activation threshold necessary for cell cycle re-entry. This mechanism plays a vital role in ensuring that cells appropriately transition from a dormant state to active division, thereby influencing overall cellular dynamics and responses to various stimuli.\",6\r\n12,CELL PROLIFERATION,,3\r\n264,E2F,\"E2F is a family of genes that encode transcription factors crucial for regulating the cell cycle. These transcription factors play a significant role in the transition from a state of quiescence, where cells are inactive, to proliferation, where cells actively divide and grow. The E2F family is integral to the control of various cellular processes, making it a key player in cell cycle regulation and overall cellular dynamics.\",3\r\n2,SHALLOW QUIESCENCE,\"\"\"Shallow quiescence\"\" refers to a less profound state of cellular dormancy characterized by a heightened ability of cells to respond to growth signals and re-enter the cell cycle. In this state, cells are more likely to revert to proliferation compared to those in deep quiescence, retaining a higher potential for reactivation upon stimulation. This phenomenon is often associated with a more active metabolic state and is particularly observed in specific cell types, such as muscle and neural stem cells, especially following tissue injury. Additionally, external factors, such as fluid flow, can influence the likelihood of cells in shallow quiescence to re-enter the cell cycle.
