This regulatory mechanism serves to halt the progression of the cell cycle, effectively preventing cells from moving forward in their division cycle. The occurrence of cell cycle arrest can lead to two potential outcomes: quiescence, where cells enter a state of temporary inactivity, or senescence, a permanent state of growth arrest. Overall, cell cycle arrest plays a significant role in maintaining cellular integrity and preventing the propagation of damaged cells, thereby contributing to the broader understanding of cellular aging and the senescence domain.\",6\r\n122,P53 PATHWAY,\"The p53 pathway is a key regulator of the cell cycle and cellular stress responses, playing a significant role in the onset of senescence.\",2\r\n182,SENESCENCE BIOMARKERS,\"Senescence biomarkers are indicators such as SA-β-gal, LAMP1, IL8, 53BP1, p21, and Lamin B1 that are used to identify senescent cells based on their expression levels.\",2\r\n201,GERICONVERSION,\"GERICONVERSION refers to the process by which cells transition from a quiescent state to a senescent state, marking an often irreversible step in cellular aging.
