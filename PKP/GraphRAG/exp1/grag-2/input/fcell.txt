The balance between cell quiescence and proliferation is fundamental to tissue physiology
and homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that quiescence is not a passive and
homogeneous state but actively maintained and heterogeneous. These cellular
characteristics associated with quiescence were observed primarily in cultured cells
under a static medium. However, cells in vivo face different microenvironmental
conditions, particularly, under interstitial ﬂuid ﬂows distributed through extracellular
matrices. Interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow exerts shear stress on cells and matrix strain, and results
in continuous replacement of extracellular factors. In this study, we analyzed individual cells
under varying ﬂuid ﬂow rates in microﬂuidic devices. We found quiescence characteristics
previously identiﬁed under conventional static medium, including serum signal-dependant
quiescence entry and exit and time-dependant quiescence deepening, are also present
under continuous ﬂuid ﬂow. Furthermore, increasing the ﬂow rate drives cells to shallower
quiescence and become more likely to reenter the cell cycle upon growth stimulation. This
effect is due to ﬂow-induced physical and biochemical cues. Speciﬁcally, increasing shear
stress or extracellular factor replacement individually, without altering other parameters,
results in shallow quiescence. We show our experimental results can be quantitatively
explained by a mathematical model connecting extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow to an Rb-E2f bistable
switch that regulates the quiescence-to-proliferation transition. Our ﬁndings uncover a
previously unappreciated mechanism that likely underlies the heterogeneous responses of
quiescent cells for tissue repair and regeneration in different physiological tissue
microenvironments.

INTRODUCTION
Quiescence is a dormant, non-proliferative cellular state. Quiescent cells, however, still maintain the
potential to proliferate upon physiological signals, making them distinct from other dormant cells
that are irreversibly arrested, such as those in senescence or terminal differentiation. Activating
quiescent cells (e.g., adult stem and progenitor cells) to proliferate is fundamental to tissue
homeostasis and repair (Coller et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2008; Li and Clevers, 2010; Cheung
and Rando, 2013). Quiescence has long been viewed as a passive cellular state lacking cell cycle

activity. Recent studies, however, have revealed that quiescence is
rather actively maintained and highly heterogeneous (Coller
et al., 2006; Sang et al., 2008; Cheung and Rando, 2013;
Spencer et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017).
The heterogeneity of quiescent cells in their proliferation
potential can be described as a graded depth. Cells in deeper
quiescence require stronger growth stimulation and take longer
to exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle than in shallower
quiescence (Augenlicht and Baserga, 1974; Kwon et al., 2017;
Fujimaki et al., 2019). Hepatocytes in older rats are an example of
deeper quiescent cells, displaying a longer delay before reentering
the cell cycle and reinitiating DNA replication following partial
hepatectomy, as compared to those in younger rats (Bucher,
1963). Certain muscle and neural stem cells after tissue injury are
examples of shallow quiescent cells, primed to reenter the cell
cycle faster upon the next damage (Rodgers et al., 2014; LlorensBobadilla et al., 2015). The dysregulation of cellular quiescence
depth can lead to disrupted tissue homeostasis, exhibiting either
an insufﬁcient number of growing cells due to an abnormally
deep quiescence, or a depleted pool of quiescent stem and
progenitor cells due to an abnormally shallow quiescence
(Orford and Scadden, 2008; Cheung and Rando, 2013;
Fujimaki and Yao, 2020).
Although dormant and non-proliferative, quiescent cells
reside in and interact with dynamic microenvironments. A
particular microenvironmental factor is the interstitial ﬂuid
ﬂowing over tissue cells, which transports nutrients and other
dissolved molecules that inﬂuence cellular activities (Jain,
1987; Swartz and Fleury, 2007; Freund et al., 2012; Yao et al.,
2013). Interstitial ﬂow also generates mechanical shear stress
on cells, which affects cell morphology, migration, growth,
and differentiation (Jain, 1987; Ng and Swartz, 2003; Tarbell
et al., 2005; Swartz and Fleury, 2007; Polacheck et al., 2011;
Shirure et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019). To date, though,
cellular quiescence has been mostly studied in cell cultures
under static medium or in animal models without examining
the effects of interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow. Whether and how
extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow affects cellular quiescence remain
largely unknown.
In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular ﬂuid
ﬂow on cellular quiescence depth using a microﬂuidic system
with a controllable medium ﬂow rate. First, we found many
quiescence characteristics previously observed in cell cultures
under a static medium were also present in the microﬂuidic
system under continuous medium ﬂow. Furthermore, the
medium ﬂow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,
the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.
This result was further explained by the combined effect of
ﬂow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellular
substance replacement. Lastly, the experimental results
were integrated into a mathematic model that helps
understand and predict how extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow
modulates quiescence depth. To the best of our knowledge,
this study is the ﬁrst to characterize the effects of extracellular
ﬂuid ﬂow on cellular quiescence, which could help better
understand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells for

tissue repair and regeneration in different physiological
contexts of living tissues.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Microﬂuidic Device Design and Fabrication
A microﬂuidic system was developed to study cellular quiescence
under medium ﬂow. To obtain sufﬁcient numbers of cells for ﬂow
cytometry analyses, a microﬂuidic device was designed featuring
a straight channel 420 μm in height, 4 mm in width, and 4 cm in
length. The microdevices, made of optically transparent
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning
Corporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging of
cells during experimentation.
The device fabrication process, illustrated in Figure 1, started
with the fabrication of a master mold. The mold with features of
microchannel patterns was made in an aluminum block using a
computer numerical control (CNC) machine based on a 3D
Computer-Aided Design (CAD). PDMS mixture, consisting of
10:1 base and curing agent, was poured onto the mold. After air
bubble removal from the mixture under vacuum, the PDMS was
cured at 55°C for 3 h. The cured PDMS substrate was then peeled
off the mold with formed microchannel grooves (Figure 1A).
After punching inlet and outlet holes at the two ends of a channel,
the PDMS microchannel was bonded with a glass slide following
oxygen plasma treatment of the bonding surfaces (Figure 1B).
Next, a pair of inlet and outlet tubing adapters was assembled for
each device to connect the microchannel to the external ﬂow
control system. The device fabrication and packaging were
completed with incubation at 55°C for an hour to enhance the
bonding strength (Figure 1C). Prior to experiments, the
microﬂuidic devices were sterilized by ﬂowing ethanol through
the microchannels, followed by UV irradiation for 1 h inside a
biosafety hood. The inner surfaces of the microchannel were
coated with 2% (w/w) ﬁbronectin to enhance the adhesion of cells
to the bottom surface.

Flow Rate and Flow-Induced Shear Stress
The total volume of medium in a microdevice (including tubing
at the inlet/outlet of the channel but not connectors, Figure 1C) is
approximately 140 μl, and the medium volume in the
microﬂuidic channel alone is about 67 µl. In this study, a
continuous medium ﬂow with a ﬁxed ﬂow rate (5 or 20 μl/h)
was fed into the channel to mimic the typical interstitial ﬂow
velocity in soft tissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007) unless otherwise
noted. Correspondingly, the ﬂow rate, rather than the priming
volume, is used to characterize the ﬂow effect. We also consider
the concentration of the bulk ﬂuid is uniform spatially, and local
diffusion and convection at the interfaces between the ﬂuid and
cells can be neglected.
Pressure-driven ﬂow in a microchannel presents a nonuniform velocity proﬁle, which gives rise to shear stress. The
shear stress for a Newtonian ﬂuid is directly proportional to the
product of the velocity gradient and ﬂuid viscosity. Assuming a 2D parabolic velocity proﬁle in a microchannel with a rectangular

(1)

REF/E23 cells used in this work were derived from rat embryonic
ﬁbroblasts REF52 cells as a single-cell clone containing a stably
integrated E2f1 promoter-driven destabilized GFP reporter (E2fGFP for short), as previously described (Yao et al., 2008). Cells
were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the growth medium:
DMEM (Coning, 15013-CV supplemented with 2x Glutamax
(Gibco, 35050)) containing 10% bovine growth serum BGS
(HyClone, SH30541.03).

where W and H are the microchannel width and height,
respectively, μ is the ﬂuid viscosity, and Q is the volumetric
ﬂow rate. For a ﬁxed medium viscosity, estimated to be μ =
0.73 cP at 37°C, and given the microchannel dimensions, W =
4 mm and H = 420 μm, the shear stress is linearly proportional to
the ﬂuid ﬂow rate. Thus, the two ﬂow rates used in this study, Q =
5 and 20 μl/h, correspond to shear stress values τw = 0.09 × 10−3
and 0.35 × 10−3 dyne/cm2, respectively (Figure 1D).
In Eq. 1, for a ﬁxed ﬂow rate and microchannel dimensions,
wall shear stress is linearly proportional to the medium viscosity.
Dextran (Sigma, D5251; ~ 500,000 average molecular weight) was
dissolved in the medium in various ﬁnal concentrations to obtain
correspondingly various medium viscosities. Table 1 summarizes
the resultant dextran-containing medium concentrations,

attachment on the bottom surface of the channel overnight,
growth medium inside the channel was replaced by a
continuous ﬂow of serum-starvation medium (0.02% BGS in
DMEM) at a designated ﬂow rate controlled by a programmable
syringe pump (Harvard PHD 2000). Cell morphologies were
found comparable across the ﬂow rate range (0–20 μl/h)
(Supplementary Figure S1A). To induce quiescence exit,
following serum starvation, the microdevice was disconnected
from the ﬂow-feeding setup (syringe and pump), and serumstimulation medium (1–4% BGS in DMEM) was gently ﬂowed
into the micro-chamber using a pipette and a tip at the inlet
tubing of the device. The medium change step is fast (<1 min for
140 µl medium) and identical to all quiescent cell groups,
avoiding the bias in the exposure time of cells to the
stimulation medium (if otherwise using slow ﬂows at different
ﬂow rates, 5 or 20 μl/h). Cells were then incubated with serumstimulation medium at static condition (again, identical to all
quiescent cell groups). After 26 h of serum stimulation, cells
inside the channel were harvested, and the intensities of E2fGFP signals from individual cells were measured using a ﬂow
cytometer (BD LSR II). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using
FlowJo software (version 10.0).
The percentage of cells with the E2f at the “On” state (E2f-On
%) in a cell population after serum stimulation was used as an
index for quiescence depth before stimulation: the smaller the
E2f-On%, the deeper the quiescence depth prior to serum
stimulation (Kwon et al., 2017). Consistent with our previous
studies in static-medium experiments (Kwon et al., 2017; Wang
et al., 2017; Fujimaki et al., 2019), E2f-On% was found
comparable to the percentage of cells with EdU incorporation
(EdU+%) in the microﬂuidic experiments under continuous
ﬂows (Supplementary Figures S1B,C). In the EdU
incorporation assay, 1 µM EdU was added to the serumstimulation medium at 0 h, and the EdU signal intensity was
measured 30 h after serum stimulation by the Click-iT EdU assay
following the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher, C10634).

RESULTS
Quiescence Induction and Deepening Over
Time are Consistent With or Without
Medium Flow
To test whether and how extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow affects cellular
quiescence, we cultured REF/E23 cells in microﬂuidic devices
under medium ﬂow (Figure 1). Two ﬂow rates (Q = 5 and 20 μl/
h) were used in this study; they generated average velocities of
0.82 and 3.33 μm/s on the microﬂuidic platform, respectively,
which are on the order of typical interstitial ﬂow velocity in soft
tissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007). Cells were seeded in
microﬂuidic devices, and cell quiescence and proliferation
status were assessed using a previously established and stably
integrated E2f-GFP reporter (Yao et al., 2008), which was
validated by standard EdU-incorporation assay in regular cell
cultures (Kwon et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Fujimaki et al.,
2019) as well as here on the microﬂuidic platform
(Supplementary Figures S1B,C; see Methods).
To induce quiescence, cells in microﬂuidic devices were
cultured in serum-starvation medium (0.02% serum) for
4 days under a given extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow (5 or 20 μl/h). In
these conditions, about 95% of cells or more entered quiescence
(Figures 2A,B, 0.02% serum, 4-days), as indicated by the Offstate of the E2f-GFP reporter (E2f-Off for short, the lower/left
mode of the E2f-GFP histograms in Figure 2). Quiescent cells
were subsequently stimulated to reenter the cell cycle with serum
at varying concentrations (without ﬂow, see Methods for details).
Cells were harvested after 26 h of serum stimulation, and the E2fGFP reporter activity was measured by ﬂow cytometry. With
increasing serum conconcentrations (0.02–4% serum, 4 days,
Figure 2), higher percentages of cells exited quiescence and
reentered the cell cycle, as indicated by the On-state of the
E2f-GFP reporter (E2f-On for short, the higher/right mode of
the E2f-GFP histograms in Figure 2). The observations that cells
entered quiescence upon serum deprivation under an
extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow and then reentered the cell cycle upon

Mathematical Modeling and Stochastic
Simulations
To account for the effects of extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow on quiescence
depth, the ﬂuid ﬂow-associated terms were added to the serum
response terms in our previously established Rb-E2F bistable
switch model (Supplementary Table S1) (Yao et al., 2008). Based
on the resultant ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework
(Supplementary Table S1), a Langevin-type stochastic
differential equation (SDE) model was constructed as follows

serum stimulation are consistent with the cell behaviors in
conventional static medium (Coller et al., 2006; Yao et al., 2008).
We next compared cells induced to quiescence by 8 vs. 4 days
of serum starvation in the presence of extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow.
Previous work, including ours, showed that cells moved into
deeper quiescence when they remained quiescent for longer
durations in conventional static-medium cell cultures
(Augenlicht and Baserga, 1974; Owen et al., 1989; Kwon et al.,
2017; Fujimaki et al., 2019). One may wonder, however, whether
this phenotype was caused by the gradual depletion of nutrients
in the static culture medium in vitro, which may behave
differently in vivo under an interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow replenishing
nutrients. In the microﬂuidic platform under a constant ﬂuid ﬂow
(either 5 or 20 μl/h) during serum starvation, we found cells that
remained quiescent for a longer period of time (8 days) entered a
deeper quiescent state and became less likely to exit: they had a
smaller E2f-On% upon a given serum stimulation than those that
remained quiescent for a shorter time (4 days, Figure 2).
Together, these results showed that cellular behaviors in 1)
serum signal-dependant quiescence entry and exit and 2)
quiescence deepening over time are consistent regardless

whether cells are in microﬂuidic devices exposed to
extracellular ﬂuid ﬂows or in conventional static-medium
cultures.

Fast Extracellular Fluid Flow Results in
Shallow Quiescence
To examine whether and how extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow may affect
cellular quiescence depth, we compared the cells induced to
quiescence by serum starvation under different medium ﬂow
rates but otherwise in the same conditions. Speciﬁcally, cells in
microﬂuidic devices were cultured in serum-starvation medium
(0.02% serum) for 4 days under an extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow (0, 5, or
20 μl/h); serum-starvation medium was then replaced by serumstimulation medium (1–4% serum) using a pipette—this medium
change procedure in each microﬂuidic device was completed
within 1 min (compared to otherwise more than 20 and 5 h under
a pump-driven slow ﬂow of 5 and 20 μl/h, respectively); cells were
then cultured in static medium during serum stimulation. This
identical serum-stimulation condition was applied in this study
(see Methods for details), so that the subsequent cell cycle reenter

proportional to the viscosity of working ﬂuid (Eq. 1), which
can be manipulated by varying the amount of high-molecularweight dextran dissolved in the medium (Table 1).
Accordingly, REF/E23 cells were ﬁrst induced to quiescence by
culturing them in the serum-starvation medium containing 0, 25,
50, or 100 mg/ml high molecular weight ( ~ 500,000) dextran,
respectively, for 4 days under 5 or 20 μl/h ﬂow rate. The cells were
then stimulated with 2% or 4% serum for 26 h, and the fraction of
cells that exited quiescence (E2f-On%) was measured. As shown
in Figures 4A,B, E2f-On% increased with increasing dextran
concentration in the serum-starvation medium under either 5 or
20 μl/h ﬂow rate. By contrast, cells cultured in static serumstarvation medium containing the same higher dextran
concentration entered deeper rather than shallower quiescence
(Supplementary Figure S2; see Discussion). These results suggest
that the dextran-induced shallow quiescence in the presence of
extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow was primarily due to the viscositydependent shear stress (instead of other dextran-associated
effects such as being a metabolic source). The higher dextran
concentration, thus higher viscosity, of the medium ﬂow
generates higher shear stress under a continuous ﬂow rate (5
or 20 μl/h, see Table 1; but not static 0 μl/h). Put together, our
results showed that increasing only the ﬂuid ﬂow shear stress,
while keeping the same ﬂow rate and pace of extracellular factor
replacement, leads to shallower quiescence.

and thus the assessment of quiescence depth were not biased by
different effective exposure time of cells to the serum-stimulation
medium (if the medium was fed by different pump-driven ﬂows)
and thus comparable across different quiescent cell groups (which
were induced by serum starvation under different medium ﬂow
rates).
Upon serum stimulation (with 1, 2, or 4% serum), the fraction
of cells reentering the cell cycle from quiescence, as indicated by
E2f-On% in Figure 3, were positively correlated with the medium
ﬂow rate applied to cells during quiescence induction (serum
starvation). These results suggest that a higher extracellular ﬂuid
ﬂow rate leads to shallower quiescence, from which cells are more
likely to reenter the cell cycle upon stimulation.

Mechanical Shear Stress Drives Shallow
Quiescence
Fluid ﬂow introduces two types of cues to cells: 1) hydrodynamic
shear stress (physical cue), and 2) continuous replenishment of
nutrients and other compounds dissolved in the ﬂuid and
removal of local cell-secreted substances (collectively as
extracellular factor replacement; biochemical cue). To
determine whether these physical and biochemical cues act
agonistically or antagonistically (thereby potentiating or
attenuating the combined effect) in affecting cellular
quiescence depth, we next conducted experiments to delineate
the effect of each of the two cues.
To isolate the effect of mechanical shear stress from that of
extracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth, the
viscosity of the culture medium was varied while its ﬂow rate (and
thus the pace of extracellular ﬂuid replacement) was maintained
at a constant level. The ﬂow-induced shear stress is linearly

“recycled-medium” at a given serum stimulation condition.
These results were obtained at the same ﬂow rate (either 5 or
20 μl/h) and thus under the same mechanical shear stress. The
difference that the cells experienced was medium replacement:
once per 24 h during the 4-days serum-starvation in the freshmedium conﬁguration, whereas no medium replacement during
the same period in the recycled-medium conﬁguration. These
results suggest that with the ﬂow rate and shear stress being equal,
extracellular factor replacement alone (as in “fresh-medium”)
induces shallower quiescence than without such a replacement
(as in “recycled-medium”).

facilitate quiescence exit and cell cycle reentry, while others may
play inhibitory roles (such as certain extracellular matrix (ECM)
factors secreted by ﬁbroblasts). To assess the net effect of
extracellular factor replacement, while decoupling it from the
effect of mechanical shear stress, we set up two test
conﬁgurations. In the ﬁrst “recycled-medium” conﬁguration, a
total ﬂuid volume of either V = 120 or 480 μl oscillated back-andforth through the microchannel at a constant ﬂow rate of either
Q = 5 or 20 μl/h, respectively. Thus, when the ﬂow direction was
switched every 24 h, the complete ﬂuid volume V passed through
the microchannel once. In the second “fresh-medium”
conﬁguration, the ﬂuid oscillated exactly as in the ﬁrst
conﬁguration, but fresh medium of volume V was supplied to
replace previous medium at each ﬂow direction switch. In both
the recycled-medium and fresh-medium experiments, cells were
serum-starved for 4 days at a given ﬂow rate Q (5 or 20 μl/h) and
subsequently stimulated with serum (1 and 2%, respectively)
for 26 h.
The quiescence depth measurements are shown in Figure 5.

A Dynamic Model of Extracellular Fluid Flow
Regulating Quiescence Depth
We next sought to develop a mathematical model to gain
potential mechanistic insight into the effects of extracellular
ﬂuid ﬂow on cellular quiescence depth. Previously, we have

Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescence

FIGURE 5 | Extracellular factor replacement drive cells to shallow quiescence. REF/E23 cells seeded in microﬂuidic devices were induced to and maintained in
quiescence by culturing them in serum-starvation medium for 4 days under the ﬂow rates of 5 μl/h (A) and 20 μl/h (B). During this period, the ﬂow direction was switched
every 24 h, after a complete volume of medium (V = 120 and 480 μl, respectively, for r = 5 and 20 μl/h) passed through the microchannel; the previous medium
(“recycled”) or a fresh medium (“fresh”) of volume V was used to continue the ﬂow experiment in the microﬂuidic device. Cells were subsequently stimulated with
serum at the indicated concentrations for 26 h, and the E2f-On% were assayed. (Top) E2f-GFP histograms with red numbers indicating the average E2f-On% from

network switch that converts graded and transient serum growth
signals into an all-or-none transition from quiescence to
proliferation (Yao et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2011). Speciﬁcally,
the minimum serum concentration required to activate this RbE2f bistable switch (the E2f-activation threshold for short)
determines quiescence depth (Yao, 2014; Kwon et al., 2017).
The experimental results in this study suggested that extracellular
ﬂuid ﬂow generates or changes physical (mechanical shear stress)
and biochemical (extracellular substances) cues that drive cells to
shallow quiescence. We hypothesized that these ﬂow-associated
cues boost the cellular responses to serum growth signals and
thereby reduce the serum level required to activate the Rb-E2f
bistable switch, which results in shallow quiescence.
Accordingly, our previously established mathematical model
of the Rb-E2f bistable switch (Yao et al., 2008) was extended,
incorporating the extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow effects (FR) into the
serum signal terms in the governing ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) (Supplementary Table S1). The augmented
model was utilized to simulate the responses (E2f-On or -Off) of
cells to serum stimulation under the inﬂuence of extracellular
ﬂuid ﬂow varying in rate. The simulations were carried out
following the chemical Langevin formulation of the ODE

framework, which considered both intrinsic and extrinsic
noise in the system (see Methods for detail), and the results
are shown in Figure 6.
A direct comparison between Figure 3B and Figure 6A
demonstrates that the simulation results, based on the ﬂuid
ﬂow-incorporated Rb-E2f bistable switch model, are
qualitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with the
experimental measurements. This ﬁnding supports our
hypothesis regarding how extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow may sensitize
cells to serum growth signals and activate the Rb-E2f bistable
switch, and thus, reduces quiescence depth. Simulation results
further show that the effect of extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow is more
pronounced than that of mechanical shear stress alone in
promoting quiescence exit (E2f-On%, Figure 6B). The “delta”
between the two curves (orange minus blue) presumably reﬂects
the effect of extracellular factor replacement in reducing
quiescence depth (dotted grey curve, Figure 6B); this effect
also increases with a higher ﬂow rate (thus, an increasing pace
of ﬂuid replacement). Although how shear stress and extracellular
factor replacement promote quiescence exit is unknown, taking a
simple assumption that shear stress and extracellular factor
replacement alone effectively corresponds to a portion (0.75

and 0.85, respectively) of the extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow term FR in
the model (Supplementary Table S1), the simulation results are
reasonably (although not perfectly) consistent with the
experimental observations (regarding the shear stress effects,
Supplementary Figure S3). Together, our modeling and
experimental results suggest that the ﬂow-induced shear stress
(physical cue) and replacement of extracellular factors
(biochemical cues) contribute agnostically to the effect of
extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow in promoting quiescence exit by
lowering the activation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.
The good agreement between simulations and experiments
motivated the application of the model for predicting the cell
responses to higher ﬂuid ﬂow rates above 20 ul/h, under which
cells started to partially detach from the microchannel bottom
surface and hence excluded from the current experimental study.
The simulation results show that the additive effect of
extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow to a given serum signal on quiescence
exit (E2f-On%) can be well ﬁtted with a Hill function (Figure 6C).
Namely, E2f-On% increases monotonically with increasing ﬂow
rate but is asymptotically bound by a serum concentration-

dependent level. By contrast, with sufﬁciently high serum
concentration, the entire cell population can exit quiescence
(i.e., E2f-On% approaches 100%) in our model even without
extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow (Figure 6D). This latter result is consistent
with what we experimentally observed previously in REF/E23
cells under static medium (Yao et al., 2008; Kwon et al., 2017;
Fujimaki et al., 2019). Therefore, it appears that extracellular ﬂuid
ﬂow facilitates quiescence exit by reducing the E2f-activation
serum threshold, but unlikely to fully replace the role of serum
growth factors in this process.

DISCUSSION
Quiescence is a reversible cellular dormancy state that can
persist over prolonged periods of time. The on-demand
reactivation of quiescent cells to divide serves as the basis
for tissue homeostasis and repair (Coller et al., 2006; Wilson
et al., 2008; Cheung and Rando, 2013). Thus far,
characteristics of cellular quiescence have been mostly

studied and discovered in conventional static-medium cell
cultures, including the basic approaches applied to induce
quiescence entry (e.g., serum deprivation, contact inhibition,
and loss of adhesion) and exit (by reverting the
aforementioned inducing signals). The microenvironment
experienced by cultured cells under static medium,
however, is different from that experienced by tissue cells
in vivo where they are exposed to continuous interstitial ﬂuid
ﬂows. The interstitial ﬂow exerts hydrodynamic shear stress
on cells due to ﬂuid ﬂow viscosity and shear strain rate; the
ﬂow also carries fresh nutrients along with dissolved
compounds and removes local substances secreted by cells
(Jain, 1987; Wiig, 1990; Wang and Tarbell, 1995; Ng and
Swartz, 2003; Swartz and Fleury, 2007; Shi and Tarbell, 2011;
Freund et al., 2012; Galie et al., 2012). As such, extracellular
ﬂuid ﬂow is known to play a critical role in repairing and
remolding tissues, such as the vascular, lung, and bone
(Hillsley and Frangos, 1994; Liu et al., 1999; Louis et al.,
2006; Rensen et al., 2007), through affecting cell morphology,
adhesion, motility, metabolism, and differentiation
(Yamamoto et al., 2005; Lutolf et al., 2009; Toh and
Voldman, 2011; Hyler et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019).
However, whether and how extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow affects
cellular quiescence remains unclear.
In this study, a microﬂuidic platform is designed to mimic the
physiologically relevant interstitial ﬂuid ﬂow with varying rates
(Figure 1) and investigate the ﬂow effects on cellular quiescence.
Experimental parameters, including ﬂow rate, ﬂuid viscosity, and
ﬂow volume, were varied to test the effects of ﬂow rate, shear stress,
and extracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth.
Our results show that, ﬁrst, several quiescence characteristics
identiﬁed previously under static medium are also present under
continuous ﬂuid ﬂow, including the serum signal-dependant
quiescence entry and exit and the time-dependant quiescence
deepening (Figure 2). Second, extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow sensitizes
cells to serum growth signals and thus leads to shallow
quiescence. Particularly, increasing the ﬂuid ﬂow rate reduces
the serum level needed for quiescence exit and cell cycle reentry.
This result is likely due to the extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow lowering the
activation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch that controls
the quiescence-to-proliferation transition (Yao et al., 2008; Kwon
et al., 2017), as suggested by our model simulations (Figure 6). A
higher ﬂuid ﬂow rate entails higher mechanical shear stress and a
faster pace of extracellular factor replacement. These physical and
biochemical cues are able to drive cells into shallow quiescence
when present either together (Figure 3) or separately (Figures 4,
5). As a result, exposed to a faster extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow, cells
become more sensitive to serum growth signals and more likely to
reenter the cell cycle.
Several questions are left unanswered in our study. First, the
molecular mechanisms are to be identiﬁed by which ﬂow-induced
shear stress and extracellular factor replacement lower the
activation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.
Interestingly, increasing medium viscosity (by a higher dextran
concentration) promotes quiescence exit under a medium ﬂow
(Figure 4), but it inhibits quiescence exit in static medium
(Supplementary Figure S2). This result may be associated

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org

with medium viscosity-induced changes in certain lipoprotein
synthesis (Yedgar et al., 1982), cytoskeleton and cell morphology
(Khorshid, 2005), cell attachment and inﬂammation (Rouleau
et al., 2010), or other cellular activities that inhibit quiescence exit
in static medium. These changes, if also present under continuous
medium ﬂow, appear to be surpassed by the effects of shear stress
that promote quiescence exit. The exact mechanism needs to be
investigated in future studies. Additionally, quiescent cells
cultured in the microﬂuidic device appear to be generally
deeper in quiescence than those cultured in well plates under
otherwise the same conditions (e.g., comparing the E2f-On%
upon 2% serum stimulation in microdevice (Figure 3) and that in
the comparable condition in well plate (Supplementary Figure
S2), both being in static medium, 0 μl/h, and without added
dextran). We speculate this difference may be due to the different
surfaces that cells were attached to (glass in the microchannel
versus plastic in the well plate), or different medium height
(<0.5 mm in the microchannel versus 3–4 mm in the well
plate) that could result in different nutrient/factor availability,
gas/heat exchange etc., or both. The exact mechanism needs to be
further investigated. Nevertheless, the current study
demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time to our best knowledge, the
direct effects of extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow and its corresponding
components (shear stress and extracellular factor replacement)
on cell quiescence depth.
Individual quiescent cells in vivo, including stem and
progenitor cells in their tissue niches, experience interstitial
ﬂuid ﬂows with varying rates and viscosities depending on
local tissue structures and distances from nearby blood vessels.
The ﬂow-driven heterogeneity in cellular quiescence depth, as
demonstrated in this study, may shed light on the heterogeneous
responses of quiescent cells in tissue repair and regeneration in
different physiological contexts of living tissues.
