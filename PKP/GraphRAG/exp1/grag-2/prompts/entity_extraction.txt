-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [cell, quiescence, serum stimulation, lysosomal function, autophagy, extracellular flow, gene expression, microenvironment, mechanical shear stress, stem cell, senescence]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

become more sensitive to serum growth signals and more likely to
reenter the cell cycle.
Several questions are left unanswered in our study. First, the
molecular mechanisms are to be identiﬁed by which ﬂow-induced
shear stress and extracellular factor replacement lower the
activation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.
Interestingly, increasing medium viscosity (by a higher dextran
concentration) promotes quiescence exit under a medium ﬂow
(Figure 4), but it inhibits quiescence exit in static medium

replacement, leads to shallower quiescence.

and thus the assessment of quiescence depth were not biased by
different effective exposure time of cells to the serum-stimulation
medium (if the medium was fed by different pump-driven ﬂows)
and thus comparable across different quiescent cell groups (which
were induced by serum starvation under different medium ﬂow
rates).
Upon serum stimulation (with 1, 2, or 4% serum), the fraction
of cells reentering the cell cycle from quiescence, as indicated by
E2f-On% in Figure 3, were positively correlated with the medium
ﬂow rate applied to cells during quiescence induction (serum
starvation). These results suggest that a higher extracellular ﬂuid
ﬂow rate leads to shallower quiescence, from which cells are more
likely to reenter the cell cycle upon stimulation.
