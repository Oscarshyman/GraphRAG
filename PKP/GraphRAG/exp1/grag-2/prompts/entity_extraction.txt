off the mold with formed microchannel grooves (Figure 1A).
After punching inlet and outlet holes at the two ends of a channel,
the PDMS microchannel was bonded with a glass slide following
oxygen plasma treatment of the bonding surfaces (Figure 1B).
Next, a pair of inlet and outlet tubing adapters was assembled for
each device to connect the microchannel to the external ﬂow
control system. The device fabrication and packaging were
completed with incubation at 55°C for an hour to enhance the
bonding strength (Figure 1C). Prior to experiments, the
microﬂuidic devices were sterilized by ﬂowing ethanol through
the microchannels, followed by UV irradiation for 1 h inside a
biosafety hood. The inner surfaces of the microchannel were
coated with 2% (w/w) ﬁbronectin to enhance the adhesion of cells
to the bottom surface.

 exact mechanisms
dictating the relationship between lysosomal function and quiescence depth awaits further studies.
Our results suggest that lysosomal function prevents quiescence deepening via ROS reduction (Fig. 6). Previous studies
have shown that the lysosome–autophagy pathway reduces ROS
in several types of quiescent cells (15, 16) through mitophagy:
That is, selective autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria (15). It remains to be tested whether lysosomes prevent
quiescence deepening in REF cells via mitophagy, but the reduced mitochondrial ROS levels resulting from enhanced lysosomal function (Fig. 6 E and F) is consistent with this model.
It was shown previously that mTORC1 can transform muscle
stem cells into a shallower quiescent state, called GAlert, in which
cells are sensitized to growth stimulation (8). Consistently, continuous mTORC1 activation led to depletion of certain types
