-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [biological process, molecular mechanism, cell type, experimental measurement, hypothesis, gene signature, quiescence, senescence, aging, lysosome, cell cycle, extracellular fluid flow, Rb-E2F switch]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

framework, which considered both intrinsic and extrinsic
noise in the system (see Methods for detail), and the results
are shown in Figure 6.
A direct comparison between Figure 3B and Figure 6A
demonstrates that the simulation results, based on the ﬂuid
ﬂow-incorporated Rb-E2f bistable switch model, are
qualitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with the
experimental measurements. This ﬁnding supports our
hypothesis regarding how extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow may sensitize
cells to serum growth signals and activate the Rb-E2f bistable
switch, and thus, reduces quiescence depth. Simulation results
further show that the effect of extracellular ﬂuid ﬂow is more

and the serum concentration required for cell cycle reentry increased from <2% to ∼8% (to achieve ∼60% EdU+ measured at
the 25th hour of serum stimulation) (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with our earlier findings that the time and serum threshold
required for cell cycle reentry are 2 related features that both reflect
the same biological state, the quiescence depth (14). Importantly,
deep quiescent cells were not irreversibly arrested. For example,
upon 20% serum stimulation, 92.6% of 16-d serum-starved deep
quiescent REF cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU+)
within 41 h (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
To identify molecular mechanisms regulating quiescence
