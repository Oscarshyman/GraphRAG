Future investigations are needed to find the answers.                    4. Conclusions      Unlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence involves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously understudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of cells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescence is expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells in our tissues than previously realized.      Understanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence transition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of biomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative medicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-specific mechanisms of quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify specific molecular markers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked senescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.
