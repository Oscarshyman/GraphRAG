Mitf-transfected cells were further treated with\ntBHP at indicated concentration for 1 h. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 4% serum for 24 h and subjected to EdU assay. (H) Model of quiescencedepth regulation by lysosomal function.\n\nNext, we found that inhibiting lysosomal function by Baf and\nCQ, which deepened quiescence, increased mitochondrial ROS\nlevel (higher MitoSox intensity) (Fig. 6 C and D). Conversely,\nenhancing lysosomal function by ectopic Mitf expression, which\nreduced quiescence depth, suppressed mitochondrial ROS\n(lower MitoSox intensity) (Fig. 6E) in a dose-dependent manner\n(Fig. 6F). Consistently, tBHP blocked the effect of Mitf on reducing quiescence depth: While the ectopic Mitf expression increased the EdU+% over control, additional tBHP treatment in\nMitf-transfected cells decreased the EdU+% in a tBHP dosedependent manner (Fig. 6G). We also considered that lysosomes may prevent quiescence deepening by increasing energy\nproduction, another known role of lysosomes (18). However,\ntreatment with metabolites known to increase ATP production,\nsuch as methyl pyruvate (MPy), did not reduce quiescence depth\nwith statistical significance (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B); it actually\nincreased quiescence depth at high concentrations (SI Appendix,\nFig. S7C), indicating that ATP generation is likely not responsible for how lysosomal function prevents quiescence deepening\nin the tested conditions, reminiscent of similar findings in yeasts\n(44). Taken together, our findings suggest that: 1) Increasing\n22630 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915905116\n\noxidative stress deepens quiescence, and reducing oxidative\nstress prevents quiescence from deepening; 2) reducing lysosomal\nfunction increases ROS, the mediator of oxidative stress, and increasing lysosomal function decreases ROS; and 3) increasing or\ndecreasing lysosomal function continuously modulates quiescence\ndepth, acting like a dimmer switch (Fig. 6H).\nQuiescence Deepening Is Linked to Cellular Senescence and Aging.\n\nFinally, we examined whether and how deep quiescence in REF\ncells is related to the quiescent states of other cell types (case Q)\nand other nongrowth cellular states, such as senescence (case S).\nTo this end, we first developed a gene-expression signature indicating the quiescence depth in REF cells by performing a\nlinear regression analysis of the time-course RNA-seq data (see\nMaterials and Methods for details). To identify a signature that\ncorresponds to a deepening of quiescence as opposed to simply\nhalting the cell cycle, we omitted the proliferating sample (0 d) from\nthe analysis and used samples corresponding to 2- to 16-d serum\nstarvation (i.e., shallow to deep quiescence) to build the regression\nmodel. We next applied this quiescence-depth signature to other\npublicly available RNA-seq datasets related to cases Q and S, above.\nFujimaki et al.\n\n\fA\n\nD\n\nlarger than that in proliferating controls (Fig. 7B). Notably, QDS\nwas constructed without involving proliferating samples (by\ncomparing shallow and deep quiescent cells under 2- to 16-d\nserum starvation) and thus likely reflects a common feature\nbetween deep quiescence and senescence. Consistently, a set of\n“senescence core signature” genes identified from metaanalysis\n(19) exhibit similar expression changes (i.e., up- or down-regulation)\nunder both deep quiescence and senescence (Fig. 7E). Furthermore, QDS was found significantly larger in aged hematopoietic\nstem cells (Fig. 7C) and monotonically increasing in all 11\nstudied rat organs undergoing aging processes from juvenile to\nadolescence, adult, and aged stages (Fig. 7D). The success of\nQDS gene signature to predict both senescence in vitro and aging\nin vivo suggests that quiescence deepening may share a molecular\nmechanistic basis with and act as a transitional state toward senescence and aging (see more in Discussion). Consistently, it was\nrecently reported that long-term cultured quiescent human fibroblasts eventually transit into senescence under physiological\noxygen conditions (45).\nDiscussion\nThe lysosome–autophagy pathway is known to protect adult stem\ncells against irreversible states, such as senescence, apoptosis,\n\nB\n\nC\n\nE\n\nFig. 7.
