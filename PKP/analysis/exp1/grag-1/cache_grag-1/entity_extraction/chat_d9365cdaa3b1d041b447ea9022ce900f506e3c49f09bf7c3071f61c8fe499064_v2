When we applied the quiescence-depth gene signature\nof REF cells to the RNA-seq data corresponding to NSCs before\nand after neural injury, we obtained quiescence depth scores\n(QDS) from the linear regression model (see Materials and\nMethods for details) to indicate the relative quiescence depth of\nNSCs. We found that the QDS of primed NSCs after injury was\nsignificantly smaller (i.e., shallower quiescence) than that of\ndormant NSCs before injury (Fig. 7A). This result suggests that\nthe quiescence-depth signature of REF cells in vitro can predict\nthe relative quiescence depth of NSCs in vivo, indicating that this\ngene signature may reflect shared quiescence regulatory mechanisms across different cell types.\nTo test case S, we analyzed RNA-seq datasets associated with\ncellular senescence and aging by applying the QDS model with\nthe quiescence-depth gene signature of REF cells. Strikingly, we\nfound that QDS correctly predicted cellular senescence and aging in a wide array of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo\n(22, 23) (Fig. 7 B–D).

The present study shows\nthat instead of a simple OFF–ON switch, lysosomes function as a\ndimmer switch to continuously modulate quiescence depth (Fig.\n6H) and proliferative capacity of quiescent cells.\nOur study suggests that as cells move deeper in quiescence,\nlysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass increase, but lysosomal function and lysosome destruction decrease. Decreased\nlysosome destruction via autophagy/lysophagy contributes to an\nincreased lysosomal mass and likely an accumulation of damaged\nlysosomes, which in turn contributes to a decreased lysosomal–\nautophagy function. Decreased lysosome destruction alone,\nhowever, does not fully explain the increased lysosomal mass\n(both lysoTracker intensity of lysosome number) observed in\ndeep quiescent cells (Fig. 2 G and H), as blocking lysosome\ndestruction increased LysoTracker intensity but not the number\nof lysosomes in REF cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S4); similarly, it was\nreported previously that lysosomal number did not change or\neven mildly decreased in autophagy-impaired fibroblasts with\nAtg4B and Atg7 mutations (46). The other contributing factor of\nincreased lysosomal mass in deep quiescence appears to be lysosomal biogenesis: The expression of Mitf, a master regulator of\nlysosomal biogenesis, significantly increased the lysosomal\nnumber (SI Appendix, Fig. S6E) in quiescent REF cells. Consistently, we found that applying small chemical inhibitors to\nrepress Mcoln1 (also known as TRPML1) that is crucial for lysosome biogenesis (47)\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
