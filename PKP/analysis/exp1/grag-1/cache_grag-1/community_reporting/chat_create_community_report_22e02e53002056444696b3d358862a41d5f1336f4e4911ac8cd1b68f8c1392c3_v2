It is closely associated with processes such as quiescence entry, senescence, and aging. Specifically, DNA damage triggers cellular responses that may result in senescence or quiescence, highlighting its critical role in the aging process and the maintenance of cellular integrity. Understanding DNA damage is essential for comprehending the dynamics of cellular behavior in the context of aging and related biological phenomena.\",3\n87,AGING,\"Aging is a biological process marked by a gradual decline in cellular function, which is accompanied by an increase in DNA damage and the accumulation of senescent cell populations. This decline not only impacts overall health and longevity but also heightens the risk of age-related diseases. As individuals age, they become more susceptible to stress and exhibit reduced autophagy, further exacerbating the effects of aging. Overall, aging is intricately linked to cellular senescence, which plays a significant role in the deterioration of biological functions and the increased likelihood of developing various health issues.\",5\n159,MAMMALIAN DNA SYNTHESIS,\"Mammalian DNA synthesis encompasses the essential processes of DNA replication and repair within mammalian cells, which are vital for both cell proliferation and quiescence.
