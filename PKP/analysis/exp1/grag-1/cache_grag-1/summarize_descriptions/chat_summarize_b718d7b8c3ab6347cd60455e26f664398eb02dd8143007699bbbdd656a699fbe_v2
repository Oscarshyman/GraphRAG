It facilitates the exit from quiescence by lowering the serum concentration threshold required for cellular activation. Additionally, extracellular fluid flow provides both physical and biochemical cues that impact the depth of quiescence, thereby affecting how cells respond to serum signals. Research has demonstrated that specific conditions of extracellular fluid flow can induce quiescence in REF/E23 cells, further underscoring the direct relationship between fluid dynamics and the quiescent state of cells. Overall, the interplay between extracellular fluid flow and quiescence highlights the importance of fluid dynamics in regulating cellular states and behaviors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1747957191, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_54eb4bd693", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 370, "total_tokens": 507, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
