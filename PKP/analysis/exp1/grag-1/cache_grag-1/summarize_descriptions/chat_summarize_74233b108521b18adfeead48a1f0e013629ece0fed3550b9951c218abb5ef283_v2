These cells possess the unique ability to differentiate into various types of neural cells, including neurons and glial cells. They can enter different states of quiescence or activation depending on environmental cues, allowing them to maintain their undifferentiated state while also being poised for rapid reentry into the cell cycle when needed. Additionally, neural stem cells can adaptively enter a shallower quiescent state in response to injury, a characteristic they share with muscle stem cells. This dynamic capability underscores their importance in neurogenesis and the brain's response to damage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1747957180, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_54eb4bd693", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 525, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
