This state is characterized by specific changes in gene expression and an increased lysosomal mass. Cells in deep quiescence are less likely to proliferate and require stronger stimuli to exit this state and re-enter the cell cycle. Environmental factors often induce deep quiescence, making it a critical aspect of cellular response to stress and nutrient availability. Overall, deep quiescence represents a significant adaptation mechanism for cells, allowing them to survive under unfavorable conditions while maintaining the potential for future proliferation when physiological conditions improve.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": []}}], "created": 1747957180, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_54eb4bd693", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 476, "total_tokens": 605, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert community analyst.
