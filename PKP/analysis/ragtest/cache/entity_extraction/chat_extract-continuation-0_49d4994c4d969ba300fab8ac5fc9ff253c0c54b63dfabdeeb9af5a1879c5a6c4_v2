Conventional senescence originates from proliferating and growing cells via mTOR-mediated geroconversion, when cell growth continues aberrantly after the cell cycle is blocked in response to severe stress and damage. In comparison, quiescence-origin senescence originates from quiescent cells via quiescence deepening, accompanied by a progressively increasing Rb–E2F switch threshold in response to decreased lysosomal autophagy and increased ROS accumulation and protein aggregation. Senescent cells are irreversibly arrested under physiological conditions. Deep quiescent cells are reversible but require stronger growth stimulation and take a longer time to re-enter the cell cycle than shallow quiescent cells. The boundary between very deep quiescence and quiescence-origin senescence (the red dashed line) is blurred.
