Hepatocytes in older rats are an example ofdeeper quiescent cells, displaying a longer delay before reenteringthe cell cycle and reinitiating DNA replication following partialhepatectomy, as compared to those in younger rats (Bucher,1963). Certain muscle and neural stem cells after tissue injury areexamples of shallow quiescent cells, primed to reenter the cellcycle faster upon the next damage (Rodgers et al., 2014;Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015). The dysregulation of cellular quiescencedepth can lead to disrupted tissue homeostasis, exhibiting eitheran insuf/uniFB01cient number of growing cells due to an abnormallydeep quiescence, or a depleted pool of quiescent stem andprogenitor cells due to an abnormally shallow quiescence(Orford and Scadden, 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013;Fujimaki and Yao, 2020).Although dormant and non-proliferative, quiescent cellsreside in and interact with dynamic microenvironments. Aparticular microenvironmental factor is the interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owing over tissue cells, which transports nutrients and otherdissolved molecules that in/uniFB02uence cellular activities (Jain,1987;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Freund et al., 2012;Yao et al.,2013). Interstitial/uniFB02ow also generates mechanical shear stresson cells, which affects cell morphology, migration, growth,and differentiation (Jain, 1987;Ng and Swartz, 2003;Tarbellet al., 2005;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Polacheck et al., 2011;Shirure et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2019). To date, though,cellular quiescence has been mostly studied in cell culturesunder static medium or in animal models without examiningthe effects of interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow. Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow. To obtain suf/uniFB01cient numbers of cells for/uniFB02owcytometry analyses, a micro/uniFB02uidic device was designed featuringa straight channel 420/uni03BCm in height, 4 mm in width, and 4 cm inlength. The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold. The mold with features ofmicrochannel patterns was made in an aluminum block using acomputer numerical control (CNC) machine based on a 3DComputer-Aided Design (CAD). PDMS mixture, consisting of10:1 base and curing agent, was poured onto the mold. After airbubble removal from the mixture under vacuum, the PDMS wascured at 55\n°C for 3 h. The cured PDMS substrate was then peeledoff the mold with formed microchannel grooves (Figure 1A).After punching inlet and outlet holes at the two ends of a channel,the PDMS microchannel was bonded with a glass slide followingoxygen plasma treatment of the bonding surfaces (Figure 1B).Next, a pair of inlet and outlet tubing adapters was assembled foreach device to connect the microchannel to the external/uniFB02owcontrol system. The device fabrication and packaging werecompleted with incubation at 55\n°C for an hour to enhance thebonding strength (Figure 1C). Prior to experiments, themicro/uniFB02uidic devices were sterilized by/uniFB02owing ethanol throughthe microchannels, followed by UV irradiation for 1 h inside abiosafety hood. The inner surfaces of the microchannel werecoated with 2% (w/w)/uniFB01bronectin to enhance the adhesion of cellsto the bottom surface.\nFlow Rate and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>PERSON<|>Hepatocytes are liver cells that play a crucial role in metabolism, detoxification, and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLDER RATS<|>PERSON<|>Older rats are used in studies to understand cellular quiescence and the effects of age on cell cycle reentry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNGER RATS<|>PERSON<|>Younger rats are used in studies to compare cellular behaviors with older rats, particularly in the context of quiescence and cell cycle reentry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL CYCLE<|>EVENT<|>The cell cycle is a series of phases that cells go through to grow and divide, including stages of growth, DNA replication, and cell division.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTIAL HEPATECTOMY<|>EVENT<|>Partial hepatectomy is a surgical procedure involving the removal of a portion of the liver, often used in studies to assess liver regeneration and cellular responses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>EVENT<|>Cellular quiescence refers to a state of dormancy in which cells are not actively dividing but can reenter the cell cycle under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TISSUE INJURY<|>EVENT<|>Tissue injury refers to damage to cells or tissues, which can trigger cellular responses including quiescence and regeneration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROENVIRONMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Microenvironments are localized environments surrounding cells that can influence their behavior, including growth and differentiation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>EVENT<|>A microfluidic system is a technology that manipulates small volumes of fluids to study biological processes at the cellular level.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATHEMATICAL MODEL<|>EVENT<|>A mathematical model is a representation of a system using mathematical concepts and language, used to predict cellular behaviors in response to various stimuli.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>OLDER RATS<|>Hepatocytes in older rats exhibit different quiescence characteristics compared to those in younger rats, impacting their cell cycle reentry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>YOUNGER RATS<|>Hepatocytes in younger rats are compared to those in older rats to study differences in cellular quiescence and regeneration<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OLDER RATS<|>CELL CYCLE<|>Older rats show a longer delay in reentering the cell cycle after partial hepatectomy compared to younger rats<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNGER RATS<|>CELL CYCLE<|>Younger rats reenter the cell cycle more quickly after partial hepatectomy compared to older rats<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARTIAL HEPATECTOMY<|>CELL CYCLE<|>Partial hepatectomy triggers the cell cycle in hepatocytes, leading to regeneration processes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>TISSUE INJURY<|>Tissue injury can lead to changes in cellular quiescence, affecting the ability of cells to reenter the cell cycle<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROENVIRONMENTS<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Microenvironmental factors influence cellular quiescence and the behavior of cells in response to stimuli<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>The microfluidic system is used to study the effects of fluid flow on cellular quiescence depth<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATHEMATICAL MODEL<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>The mathematical model helps predict how extracellular fluid flow modulates quiescence depth<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
