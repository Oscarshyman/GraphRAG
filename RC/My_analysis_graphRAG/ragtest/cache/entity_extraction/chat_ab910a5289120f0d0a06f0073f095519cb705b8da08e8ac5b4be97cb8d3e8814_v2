Thus, here we tested whether lysosomal\n\nfunction potentially prevents quiescence deepening by anti-\n\noxidation. If it does, we reasoned that increasing antioxidation in\nthe cell would reduce quiescence depth. Indeed, we found that\nsupplementing antioxida\nnt 2-mercaptoethanol (\nβ\nME) drove\n\nquiescent cells into a shallower state, from which cells became\nmore sensitive to growth signals (higher EdU\n+\n% upon serum\nstimulation) (Fig. 6\n\nA\n); conversely, supplementing an oxidative\n\nreagent tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) drove cells into deeper\nquiescence, shown by the lower EdU\n+\n% (Fig. 6\n\nB\n) and lower E2f-\n\nON% (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S7\nA\n) upon stimulation at a given serum\n\nconcentration with increasing tBHP concentration. These results\nindicate that the degree of oxidative stress is positively correlated\nwith quiescence depth.\n\n\nABCD\n\nE\n\nFG\n\nFig. 5.\n\nEnhancing lysosomal function pushes cells toward shallower quiescence.

Cells were cotransfected with Mitf-GFP and mCherry ex-\n\npression vectors (Mitf/mCherry, triplicates) or mCherry control alone (mCherry, duplicates) and induced to quiescence by 4-d serum starvation.

Cells were grouped accor\nding to\n\ntheir mCherry intensity (log-transformed) into 22 even-width bins (bins with cell number\n\n<\n40 or with background fluorescence level similar to nontransfected\n\ncells were filtered out).

(\nG\n) Quiescence-depth assay in mCherry or Mitf/mCherry transfected cells. Transfected cells were induced to quiescence by\n\n4-d serum starvation and stimulated with 0.5% serum. EdU\n+\n% was measured after 24 h of serum stimulation (in 7 and 9 replicates of mCherry and mCherry/\nMitf transfection, respectively;\n\n∼\n10,000 cells each).
