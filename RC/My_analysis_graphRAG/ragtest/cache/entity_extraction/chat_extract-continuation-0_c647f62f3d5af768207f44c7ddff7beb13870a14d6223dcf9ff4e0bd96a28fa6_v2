Prior to experiments, themicro/uniFB02uidic devices were sterilized by/uniFB02owing ethanol throughthe microchannels, followed by UV irradiation for 1 h inside abiosafety hood. The inner surfaces of the microchannel werecoated with 2% (w/w)/uniFB01bronectin to enhance the adhesion of cellsto the bottom surface.\nFlow Rate and Flow-Induced Shear Stress\nThe total volume of medium in a microdevice (including tubingat the inlet/outlet of the channel but not connectors,Figure 1C)isapproximately 140/uni03BCl, and the medium volume in themicro/uniFB02uidic channel alone is about 67 µl. In this study, acontinuous medium/uniFB02ow with a/uniFB01xed/uniFB02ow rate (5 or 20/uni03BCl/h)was fed into the channel to mimic the typical interstitial/uniFB02owvelocity in soft tissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007) unless otherwisenoted. Correspondingly, the/uniFB02ow rate, rather than the primingvolume, is used to characterize the/uniFB02ow effect. We also considerthe concentration of the bulk/uniFB02uid is uniform spatially, and localdiffusion and convection at the interfaces between the/uniFB02uid andcells can be neglected.Pressure-driven/uniFB02ow in a microchannel presents a non-uniform velocity pro/uniFB01le, which gives rise to shear stress. Theshear stress for a Newtonian/uniFB02uid is directly proportional to theproduct of the velocity gradient and/uniFB02uid viscosity.

For a/uniFB01xed medium viscosity, estimated to be/uni03BC=0.73 cP at 37\n°C, and given the microchannel dimensions,W=4 mm andH= 420/uni03BCm, the shear stress is linearly proportional tothe/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate. Thus, the two/uniFB02ow rates used in this study,Q=5 and 20/uni03BCl/h, correspond to shear stress valuesτ\nw= 0.09 × 10−3\nand 0.35 × 10−3dyne/cm2, respectively (Figure 1D).InEq. 1, for a/uniFB01xed/uniFB02ow rate and microchannel dimensions,wall shear stress is linearly proportional to the medium viscosity.Dextran (Sigma, D5251; ~ 500,000 average molecular weight) wasdissolved in the medium in various/uniFB01nal concentrations to obtaincorrespondingly various medium viscosities.Table 1summarizesthe resultant dextran-containing medium concentrations,viscosity at 37°C, and corresponding shear stress values for thetwo/uniFB02ow rates (Carrasco et al., 1989).\nCell Culture\nREF/E23 cells used in this work were derived from rat embryonic/uniFB01broblasts REF52 cells as a single-cell clone containing a stablyintegrated E2f1 promoter-driven destabilized GFP reporter (E2f-GFP for short), as previously described (Yao et al., 2008).
