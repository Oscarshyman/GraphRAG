The microenvironmentexperienced by cultured cells under static medium,however, is different from that experienced by tissue cellsin vivowhere they are exposed to continuous interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows. The interstitial/uniFB02ow exerts hydrodynamic shear stresson cells due to/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow viscosity and shear strain rate; the/uniFB02ow also carries fresh nutrients along with dissolvedcompounds and removes local substances secreted by cells(Jain, 1987;Wiig, 1990;Wang and Tarbell, 1995;Ng andSwartz, 2003;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Shi and Tarbell, 2011;Freund et al., 2012;Galie et al., 2012). As such, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow is known to play a critical role in repairing andremolding tissues, such as the vascular, lung, and bone(Hillsley and Frangos, 1994;Liu et al., 1999;Louis et al.,2006;Rensen et al., 2007), through affecting cell morphology,adhesion, motility, metabolism, and differentiation(Yamamoto et al., 2005;Lutolf et al., 2009;Toh andVoldman, 2011;Hyler et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019).However, whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affectscellular quiescence remains unclear.In this study, a micro/uniFB02uidic platform is designed to mimic thephysiologically relevant interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow with varying rates(Figure 1) and investigate the/uniFB02ow effects on cellular quiescence.Experimental parameters, including/uniFB02ow rate,/uniFB02uid viscosity, and/uniFB02ow volume, were varied to test the effects of/uniFB02ow rate, shear stress,and extracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth.Our results show that,/uniFB01rst, several quiescence characteristicsidenti/uniFB01ed previously under static medium are also present undercontinuous/uniFB02\nuid/uniFB02ow, including the serum signal-dependantquiescence entry and exit and the time-dependant quiescencedeepening (Figure 2). Second, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow sensitizescells to serum growth signals and thus leads to shallowquiescence. Particularly, increasing the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate reducesthe serum level needed for quiescence exit and cell cycle reentry.This result is likely due to the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow lowering theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch that controlsthe quiescence-to-proliferation transition (Yao et al., 2008;Kwonet al., 2017), as suggested by our model simulations (Figure 6). Ahigher/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate entails higher mechanical shear stress and afaster pace of extracellular factor replacement. These physical andbiochemical cues are able to drive cells into shallow quiescencewhen present either together (Figure 3) or separately (Figures 4,5). As a result, exposed to a faster extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow, cellsbecome more sensitive to serum growth signals and more likely toreenter the cell cycle.Several questions are left unanswered in our study. First, themolecular mechanisms are to be identi/uniFB01ed by which/uniFB02ow-inducedshear stress and extracellular factor replacement lower theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.Interestingly, increasing medium viscosity (by a higher dextranconcentration) promotes quiescence exit under a medium/uniFB02ow(Figure 4), but it inhibits quiescence exit in static medium(Supplementary Figure S2). This result may be associatedwith medium viscosity-induced changes in certain lipoproteinsynthesis (Yedgar et al., 1982), cytoskeleton and cell morphology(Khorshid, 2005), cell attachment and in/uniFB02ammation (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology is a scientific journal that publishes research articles in the field of cell and developmental biology.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIU ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Liu et al. refers to the authors of the study who conducted research on extracellular flow and its effects on cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAIN<|...|>PERSON<|>Jain is one of the referenced authors in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIG<|...|>PERSON<|>Wiig is another referenced author in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WANG AND TARBELL<|...|>PERSON<|>Wang and Tarbell are referenced authors in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NG AND SWARTZ<|...|>PERSON<|>Ng and Swartz are referenced authors in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWARTZ AND FLEURY<|...|>PERSON<|>Swartz and Fleury are referenced authors in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHI AND TARBELL<|...|>PERSON<|>Shi and Tarbell are referenced authors in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREUND ET AL.<|...|>PERSON<|>Freund et al. are referenced authors in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GALIE ET AL.<|...|>PERSON<|>Galie et al. are referenced authors in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HILLSLEY AND FRANGOS<|...|>PERSON<|>Hillsley and Frangos are referenced authors in the study, contributing to the understanding of interstitial flow and its effects on cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIU ET AL.
