The initial pulsatile response of lysosomal mass was\n\nlikely due to an adaptive mammalian target of rapamycin\n(mTOR)-autophagy response to serum starvation, as previously\n\nreported (31). The continuously increased LysoTracker intensity\n\nin deep quiescence was consistent with an increased number of\n\nlysosomes, another indicator of lysosomal mass; for example,\n\n11-d serum-starved cells exhibited significantly more lysosomal foci\n\nper cell and per unit area of cell than 2-d serum-starved cells (per\nA\n\nB\nC\n\nFig. 1.\n\nSequential quiescence deepening and transcriptome change in\n\nserum-starved REF cells over time.
