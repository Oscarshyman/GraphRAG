Remarkably, the expression of Mitf and Tfe3 but not Tfeb\n\nincreased significantly in deep quiescence (Fig. 5\n\nA\n)(\nP\n=\n0.028, 0.032,\n\nand 0.827 for Mitf, Tfe3, and Tf\neb, respectively, in a 1-tailed\nt\ntest\n\ncomparing 16-d and 2-d serum-sta\nrved cells); meanwhile, Mitf but\n\nnot Tfeb and Tfe3 showed a high degree of coexpression with lyso-\n\nsomal genes in quiescence (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S6\n C\n). Together, these\n\nresults suggested a unique role for Mitf in regulating lysosomal\nfunction in the quiescent REF cell model. Indeed, we found that\nectopic Mitf expression in quiescent REF cells (arrow in\n\nSI Appendix\n,\n\nFig. S6\n\nD\n) significantly increased both the LysoTracker intensity (\nP\n=\n\n\n0.017 in a 1-tailed\n\nt\ntest) (Fig. 5\nB\nand\nC\n) and lysosomal number (\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S6\n E\n) in the cell, as well as enhanced autophagy flux\n\n(higher LC3-II\n\n/uni0394\n)(Fig.5\n D\n), demonstrating the ability of Mitf to\n\nincrease lysosomal biogenesis and fu\nnction. Consistently, ectopic Mitf\n\nexpression pushed cells into shallower quiescence, as seen in both a\n\nhigher EdU\n+\n% upon serum stimulation (Fig. 5\n\nE\n) and a shorter time\n\nto reenter the cell cycle (Fig. 5\n\nF\n). Notably, there was a monotonic\n\ncorrelation between the level of i\nntroduced Mitf expression vector\n\n(indicated by mCherry intensity) (\n\nx\naxis in Fig. 5\nG\n) and the\nEdU\n+\nlevel upon serum stimulation (normalized to mCherry con-\n\ntrol) (\n\ny\naxis in Fig. 5\nG\n), suggesting that cells can be continuously\n\ndriven to shallower quiescence by enhancing lysosomal function.\n\nLysosomal Function Prevents Quiescence Deepening via ROS Reduction.\n\nLysosomes are\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MITF<|>PERSON<|>Mitf is a protein that plays a unique role in regulating lysosomal function in quiescent REF cells, enhancing lysosomal biogenesis and function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REF CELLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>REF cells are a model used to study quiescence and lysosomal function, particularly in the context of cell cycle reentry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lysosomes are cellular organelles involved in the degradation and recycling of cellular waste, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERUM STIMULATION<|>EVENT<|>Serum stimulation refers to the process of adding serum to cells to induce cell cycle reentry and other cellular responses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>EVENT<|>Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, which is enhanced by Mitf expression in quiescent REF cells.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MITF<|>REF CELLS<|>Mitf expression significantly increases lysosomal biogenesis and function in REF cells, affecting their quiescent state<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MITF<|>LYSOSOMES<|>Mitf regulates lysosomal function, enhancing their biogenesis and activity in quiescent cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>SERUM STIMULATION<|>REF cells undergo cell cycle reentry upon serum stimulation, which is influenced by Mitf expression<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MITF<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Mitf enhances autophagy flux in quiescent REF cells, indicating its role in cellular recycling processes<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
