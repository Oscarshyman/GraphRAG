Speci/uniFB01cally,the minimum serum concentration required to activate this Rb-E2f bistable switch (the E2f-activation threshold for short)determines quiescence depth (Yao, 2014;Kwon et al., 2017).The experimental results in this study suggested that extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow generates or changes physical (mechanical shear stress)and biochemical (extracellular substances) cues that drive cells toshallow quiescence. We hypothesized that these/uniFB02ow-associatedcues boost the cellular responses to serum growth signals andthereby reduce the serum level required to activate the Rb-E2fbistable switch, which results in shallow quiescence.Accordingly, our previously established mathematical modelof the Rb-E2f bistable switch (Yao et al., 2008) was extended,incorporating the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow effects (FR) into theserum signal terms in the governing ordinary differentialequations (ODEs) (Supplementary Table S1). The augmentedmodel was utilized to simulate the responses (E2f-On or -Off) ofcells to serum stimulation under the in/uniFB02uence of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow varying in rate. The simulations were carried outfollowing the chemical Langevin formulation of the ODEframework, which considered both intrinsic and extrinsicnoise in the system (see Methods for detail), and the resultsare shown inFigure 6.A direct comparison betweenFigure 3BandFigure 6Ademonstrates that the simulation results, based on the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow-incorporated Rb-E2f bistable switch model, arequalitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with theexperimental measurements. This/uniFB01nding supports ourhypothesis regarding how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow may sensitizecells to serum growth signals and activate the Rb-E2f bistableswitch, and thus, reduces quiescence depth. Simulation resultsfurther show that the effect of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow is morepronounced than that of mechanical shear stress alone inpromoting quiescence exit (E2f-On%,Figure 6B). The“delta”between the two curves (orange minus blue) presumably re/uniFB02ectsthe effect of extracellular factor replacement in reducingquiescence depth (dotted grey curve,Figure 6B); this effectalso increases with a higher/uniFB02ow rate (thus, an increasing paceof/uniFB02uid replacement). Although how shear stress and extracellularfactor replacement promote quiescence exit is unknown, taking asimple assumption that shear stress and extracellular factorreplacement alone effectively corresponds to a portion (0.75\n\nFIGURE 5 |Extracellular factor replacement drive cells to shallow quiescence.
