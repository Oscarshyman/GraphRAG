For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60% EdU\n+\nrate) (Fig. 1\nA\nand\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S1\n C\n),\n\nand the serum concentration req\nuired for cell cycle reentry in-\n\ncreased from\n\n<\n2% to\n∼\n8% (to achieve\n∼\n60% EdU\n+\nmeasured at\n\nthe 25th hour of serum stimulation) (Fig. 1\n\nB\n). This result is con-\n\nsistent with our earlier findings that the time and serum threshold\nrequired for cell cycle reentry are 2\nrelated features that both reflect\n\nthe same biological state, the quiescence depth (14). Importantly,\n\ndeep quiescent cells were not irre\nversibly arrested. For example,\n\nupon 20% serum stimulation, 92.\n6% of 16-d serum-starved deep\n\nquiescent REF cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU\n+\n)\n\nwithin 41 h (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S1\n B\n).\n\nTo identify molecular mechanisms regulating quiescence\ndepth at the transcriptional level, we performed RNA-sequencing\n\n(RNA-seq) analysis of 0- to 16-d serum-starved cells (26). As\n\nexpected, the expression of well-characterized proliferation\ngenes\n\n—\nsuch as E2f1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 (\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n A\n)\n—\n\n\nE2f1 target genes (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n B\n), and proliferation-\n\nrelated gene clusters (#7 and 9,\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n C\n)was\n\nquickly down-regulated within 2-d serum starvation. Conversely,\nthe expression of growth inhibitory genes, such as Rb1, Cdkn1a\n(p21Cip1), and Cdkn1b (p27Kip1), was up-regulated upon se-\n\nrum starvation (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n A\n). The expression of Cdkn2a\n\n(p16INK4A), a senescence marker (27), remained low as cells\nmoved deeper in quiescence (3- to 16-d serum starvation) (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S2\n D\n), consistent with quiescence being a\n\nreversible state.\n\nThe global gene-expression profile changed drastically when\ncells transitioned from proliferation to quiescence (0- to 2-d\n\nserum starvation) and continued to change sequentially as cells\n\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (2- to 16-d serum star-\nvation) (Fig. 1\n\nC\n). This sequential change was reflected in 9 gene\n\nclusters that exhibited different temporal dynamic patterns (Fig.\n\n2\n\nA\nand\nB\n). In particular, the expression of 2 gene clusters\n\nappeared to be positively correlated with quiescence deepening\nand increased monotonically as cells moved from shallow to\n\ndeep quiescence (clusters 1 and 3) (Fig. 2\n\nB\n). In cluster 1, mul-\n\ntiple biological functions were enriched; among them, lysosome\n\nwas overall the most statistically significant in Kyoto Encyclo-\n\npedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) overrepresentation tests\n\n[Fig. 2\n\nC\n, using clusterProfiler (28);\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n, using\n\nDAVID (29)]. In cluster 3, lysosome was the single function\n\nsignificantly enriched statistically (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n). Con-\n\nsistently, lysosomal genes also had the strongest positive corre-\n\nlation with deep quiescence in gene set enrichment analysis\n\n(GSEA) (30) (normalized enrichment score [NES]\n\n=\n3.12)\n\n(Fig. 2\n\nD\n).\n\nLysosomal Gene Expression and Lysosomal Mass Increase as Quiescence\n\nDeepens.\nThe vast majority of lysosomal genes, encoding for various\n\nlysosomal enzymes, activator proteins, membrane proteins, and ion\n\nchannel proteins, increased their expression continuously as cells\n\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (Fig. 2\n\nE\n[cluster C and the\n\nbottom half of cluster A], Fig. 2\n\nF\n,and\n SI Appendix\n,Fig.S3\n A\n). As a\n\ncomparison, the expression of most genes associated with endo-\n\nsomes, another cellular organelle in the endosomal\n\n–\nlysosomal sys-\n\ntem, only increased significantly during the first 2 d of serum\n\nstarvation but not afterward as quiescence continued to deepen\n(Fig. 2\n\nF\nand\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S3\n B\nand\nC\n).\n\nLysosomal mass also increased in deep quiescence: Following\n\na brief pulsatile adaptive response (within the first 6 h) upon\n\nserum starvation, lysosomal mass continuously increased over\n\nthe next 14 d, as seen from the stained LysoTracker intensity\n\n(Fig. 2\n\nG\n). The initial pulsatile response of lysosomal mass was\n\nlikely due to an adaptive mammalian target of rapamycin\n(mTOR)-autophagy response to serum starvation, as previously\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOME<|>GEO<|>Lysosomes are cellular organelles that increase in mass and gene expression as cells transition from shallow to deep quiescence during serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>EVENT<|>Serum starvation is a condition where cells are deprived of serum, leading to changes in cell cycle reentry and gene expression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E2F1<|>PERSON<|>E2F1 is a well-characterized proliferation gene that is down-regulated during serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CDK2<|>PERSON<|>CDK2 is a proliferation-related gene that is affected by serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CDK4<|>PERSON<|>CDK4 is another proliferation-related gene that is down-regulated during serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB1<|>PERSON<|>RB1 is a growth inhibitory gene that is up-regulated upon serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CDKN1A<|>PERSON<|>CDKN1A, also known as p21Cip1, is a growth inhibitory gene that increases expression during serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CDKN1B<|>PERSON<|>CDKN1B, also known as p27Kip1, is a growth inhibitory gene that is up-regulated during serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CDKN2A<|>PERSON<|>CDKN2A, also known as p16INK4A, is a senescence marker that remains low as cells deepen in quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REF CELLS<|>PERSON<|>REF cells are a type of cell that can reenter the cell cycle after serum stimulation, even after prolonged serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOME<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>Lysosomal mass and gene expression increase as a response to serum starvation, indicating a relationship between the two<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E2F1<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>E2F1 is down-regulated during serum starvation, showing its relationship with the event<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CDK2<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>CDK2 is down-regulated during serum starvation, indicating its involvement in the cellular response<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CDK4<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>CDK4 is down-regulated during serum starvation, showing its relationship with the event<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RB1<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>RB1 is up-regulated during serum starvation, indicating its role in the cellular response<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CDKN1A<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>CDKN1A is up-regulated during serum starvation, showing its involvement in the event<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CDKN1B<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>CDKN1B is up-regulated during serum starvation, indicating its relationship with the event<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CDKN2A<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>CDKN2A remains low during serum starvation, showing its relationship with the quiescent state<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>REF cells can reenter the cell cycle after serum stimulation, indicating their response to serum starvation<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
