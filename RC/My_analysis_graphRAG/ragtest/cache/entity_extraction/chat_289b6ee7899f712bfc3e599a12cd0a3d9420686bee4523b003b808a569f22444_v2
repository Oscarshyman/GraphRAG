This result may be associatedwith medium viscosity-induced changes in certain lipoproteinsynthesis (Yedgar et al., 1982), cytoskeleton and cell morphology(Khorshid, 2005), cell attachment and in/uniFB02ammation (Rouleauet al., 2010), or other cellular activities that inhibit quiescence exitin static medium. These changes, if also present under continuousmedium/uniFB02ow, appear to be surpassed by the effects of shear stressthat promote quiescence exit. The exact mechanism needs to beinvestigated in future studies. Additionally, quiescent cellscultured in the micro/uniFB02uidic device appear to be generallydeeper in quiescence than those cultured in well plates underotherwise the same conditions (e.g., comparing the E2f-On%upon 2% serum stimulation in microdevice (Figure 3) and that inthe comparable condition in well plate (Supplementary FigureS2), both being in static medium, 0/uni03BCl/h, and without addeddextran). We speculate this difference may be due to the differentsurfaces that cells were attached to (glass in the microchannelversusplastic in the well plate), or different medium height(<0.5 mm in the microchannelversus3–4 mm in the wellplate) that could result in different nutrient/factor availability,gas/heat exchange etc., or both. The exact mechanism needs to befurther investigated. Nevertheless, the current studydemonstrated, for the/uniFB01rst time to our best knowledge, thedirect effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow and its correspondingcomponents (shear stress and extracellular factor replacement)on cell quiescence depth.Individual quiescent cellsin vivo, including stem andprogenitor cells in their tissue niches, experience interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows with varying rates and viscosities depending onlocal tissue structures and distances from nearby blood vessels.The/uniFB02ow-driven heterogeneity in cellular quiescence depth, asdemonstrated in this study, may shed light on the heterogeneousresponses of quiescent cells in tissue repair and regeneration indifferent physiological contexts of living tissues.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included inthe article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can bedirected to the corresponding authors.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nBL, LJ, JX, YZ, and GY designed research; BL performedexperiments; XW performed mathematical modeling andsimulation; LJ designed, fabricated, and con/uniFB01gured themicro/uniFB02uidic system; BL, LJ, and GY analyzed data; BL, YZ, LJ,and GY wrote the paper.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by grants from the NSF of USA(#2016035 and #3038431 to GY), the Startup Fund forscienti/uniFB01c research of Fujian Medical University (#2017XQ2016to BL), and the NSF of China (#31500676 to XW).\n\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 79271910\nLiu et al.Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow QuiescenceACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the Foundation for Scholarly Exchange of FujianMedical University for sponsoring BL.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at:https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.792719/full#supplementary-material\nSupplementary Figure S1 |Experimental system con/uniFB01guration and validation.(A) Cell morphology under varying medium/uniFB02ow rates.
