In particular, we\n\nfound that lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass (in-\n\ndicated by the intensity of lysosomal staining and the number of\n\nlysosomes per cell) continuously increase as quiescence deepens;\n\nhowever, autophagy flux decreases. Lysosomes are hydrolytic\n\nenzyme-filled organelles in the cell that break down many types of\n\nbiomolecules; lysosomal function, primarily through processes of\n\nautophagy and endocytosis, has been shown to prevent irreversible\n\ncellular states, such as senescenc\ne, terminal differentiation, and\n\nSignificance\nReactivating sleep-like quiescent cells in the body (most nota-\n\nbly stem cells) to divide is fundamental to tissue homeostasis\n\nand regeneration. Like sleep having shallow and deep stages,\nquiescence exhibits graded depths with different speeds and\nrates responding to stimulation signals. Understanding how\n\nquiescence depth is regulated is fundamental to our under-\n\nstanding of tissue repair and regeneration. Here we show that\nquiescence depth is regulated like a\n\n“\ndimmer switch\n”\nby lyso-\n\nsomes (cell organelles that break down and recycle biomole-\n\ncules), through the lysosomal function of reducing oxidative\nstress. We developed a gene signature to predict quiescence\ndepth and show that quiescence deepening likely represents a\n\ntransition path from cell division to irreversibly arrested se-\n\nnescence, related to the aging process.\n\nAuthor contributions: K.F., R.L., J.X., F.B., and G.Y. designed research; K.F., R.L., H.C., and\n\nK.D.C. performed research; K.F., R.L., H.C., K.D.C., H.H.Z., J.X., F.B., and G.Y. analyzed\ndata; and K.F., F.B., and G.Y. wrote the paper.\n\nThe authors declare no competing interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\nPublished under the\nPNAS license.\n\nData deposition: The data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Gene Ex-\n\npression Omnibus (GEO) database,\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo(accession no.\n\nGSE124109\n).\n1K.F. and R.L. contributed equally to this work.\n2To whom correspondence may be addressed.

Here we found that the increased lysosomal mass\n\nin deep quiescent cells is, in part, due to decreased autophagy flux,\n\nwhich is partially but not fully compensated by increased lysosomal\n\ngene expression and lysosomal biogenesis. We show that lysosomal\nfunction, like a dimmer switch, cont\ninuously regulates quiescence\n\ndepth and thus the proliferative potential of quiescent cells by re-\n\nducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We\n\nfound that a set of\n\n“\nsenescence core signature\n”\ngenes (19) show\n\nsimilar expression patterns in deep quiescence as in senescence, and\nthat a gene-expression signature w\ne developed to indicate cellular\n\nquiescence depth by comparing deep and shallow quiescent REF\n\ncells is able to correctly classify senescent and aging cells in a wide\narray of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo (22, 23),\n\nsuggesting that deep quiescence may serve as a common transition\n\npath from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\n\nResults\nDynamic Transcriptome Changes during Quiescence Deepening.\nSimilar\n\nto our previous observation (14), REF cells moved into deeper\nquiescence progressively with longer-term serum starvation. After\n2-d serum starvation, the entire cell population entered quiescence, as\n\ndemonstrated by their negative D\nNA incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2\n′\n-\n\ndeoxyuridine (EdU) and a complete shut-off of E2f1 expression (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S1\n B\n). E2f1 is a member of the E2f family of tran-\n\nscription factors; it up-regulates a large battery of genes involved in\n\nDNA replication and cell cycle progression, acting as the key ef-\n\nfector of an Rb-E2f bistable switch that controls the all-or-none\ntransition from quiescence to proliferation (24, 25). With in-\n\ncreasingly longer serum starvati\non, cells moved into deeper quies-\n\ncence, requiring a longer time and a greater serum stimulation\nstrength (concentration) to reen\nter the cell cycle than cells in\n\nshallower quiescence. For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
