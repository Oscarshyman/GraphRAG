Cells were\n\npassaged every 2 to 3 d and maintained at subconfluency in growth me-\n\ndium: DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (BGS; GE\n\nHealthcare, SH30541). To induce quiescence, cells were plated at\n\n∼\n50%\n\nconfluence in growth medium for a day, washed twice with DMEM, and\n\ncultured in serum-starvation medium (DMEM containing 0.02% BGS) for the\n\nindicated duration (\n\n≥\n2d).\n\n\nQuiescence-Depth Assay.\n\nTo assess quiescence depth, cells were switched from\n\nserum-starvation medium to serum-stimulation medium (DMEM containing\n\nBGS at indicated concentrations) and harvested at indicated time points by\n\ntrypsinization. The cell fraction that reentered the cell cycle was quantified by\n\nassessing the profile of EdU incorporation (and the profiles of E2f-GFP re-\n\nporter and PI DNA staining when indicated). Quiescence depth is determined\n\nby the serum threshold required to activate cells to reenter the cell cycle. At a\n\ngiven serum concentration, a smaller percentage of deeper quiescent cells are\n\nable to reenter the cell cycle by a given time than of shallower quiescent cells.\n\nSee text for details.\n\n\nData Availability.\n\nThe data reported in this paper have been deposited in the\n\nGene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database,\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\n\ngeo\n(accession no.
