However,\na comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic landscape changes during quiescence\ndeepening and the quiescence-to-senescence transition is still lacking, highlighting an\nimportant area for future research [40].\nThe heterogeneity and context dependency of the quiescence-to-senescence transition\nare also apparent, underscoring the complexity of these cellular processes. For instance,\nROS-mediated p16INK4aactivation occurs through epigenetic derepression in MuSCs [18]\nbut via p38 MAPK hyperactivation in HSPCs [14]. Blocking p16INK4aactivation prevents the\nquiescence-to-senescence transition only in a subset of cells [13], suggesting the involvement\nof other molecular effectors driving the quiescence-origin senescence. Furthermore, is\nlysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition\nto senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb‚ÄìE2F switch threshold‚Äîor\npossibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream\nE2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]? Growing cells exiting from either\nthe G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle converge onto the same senescent state with a G1-like\nmolecular signature [76]. How about quiescence-origin senescence? What are its molecular\nmarkers, and to what extent do they overlap with or differ from the markers of proliferation-\norigin senescence, beyond the sustained (if not totally irreversible) arrested phenotype\n(Figure 1)? Future investigations are needed to Ô¨Ånd the answers.\n4. Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciÔ¨Åc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciÔ¨Åc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported by the Research Development Grant of the University\nof Arizona.\nConÔ¨Çicts of Interest:The authors declare no conÔ¨Çicts of interest.
