Furthermore, the transcriptomic proﬁle changes during qui-\nescence deepening in REFs resemble those of senescence entry with similar expression\nchanges in “senescence core signature” genes [16,49]. A gene signature derived from\nquiescence deepening in REFs, the quiescence depth score (QDS), can correctly predict a\nwide array of senescent and aging cell types [16,50]. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that\nquiescence deepening represents a continuum transition trajectory from proliferation to\nsenescence, which is a model increasingly recognized in the ﬁeld [9,51–55].\nSupporting the quiescence–senescence continuum concept, the levels of multiple\nwidely used senescence biomarkers (e.g., SA-β-gal, LAMP1, IL8, 53BP1, p21, Lamin B1, and\ncell size) were found to increase gradually with the duration of cell-cycle withdrawal and\ncannot distinguish senescence from deep quiescence [56]. This quiescence–senescence con-\ntinuum could help explain some normal physiological functions of cellular senescence [57],\nas some of the senescent cells identiﬁed based on biomarker intensities may instead be\ndeep quiescent cells.\n3. Mechanisms Underlying Quiescence Deepening and Quiescence-Origin Senescence\nThe cellular processes underlying quiescence deepening and transition to senescence\nlikely involve a complex interplay between various cellular mechanisms and signaling\npathways. Yet, a converging theme has started to emerge from recent studies.\n3.1. Trigger: The Lysosome–Autophagy Axis\nThe lysosome–autophagy axis has emerged as a critical driver of quiescence deepening\nand transition to senescence across various cell types. Autophagy involves autophagosomes\nengulﬁng cellular components and fusing with lysosomes, where lysosomal enzymes\ndegrade the contents and recycle the macromolecules. This lysosome–autophagy activity\nacts as a “dimmer switch” regulating quiescence depth in REFs with its continuously\ndecreased activity leading to progressively deeper quiescence toward senescence [16]. It\nalso underlies the quiescence-to-senescence transition in geriatric MuSCs [18].\nIn both REFs and geriatric MuSCs, ROS accumulation serves as a key effector of the im-\npaired lysosomal autophagy function [16,18]. In REFs, ROS accumulation, without evoking\np16INK4a, leads to quiescence deepening [16]; in MuSCs, ROS accumulation epigenetically\nderepresses the p16INK4alocus and leads to the quiescence-to-senescence transition [18].\nSimilarly, ROS accumulation drives the quiescence-to-senescence transition in HSPCs by\nelevating the p16INK4alevel [14].\nIn neural stem cells (NSCs), the lysosome–autophagy axis, with increased protein\naggregates as the main effector, plays a crucial role in quiescence deepening. Aging\nquiescent NSCs display lysosomal defects, increased protein aggregates, and diminished\nactivation potential [58].\nEnhancing lysosomal autophagy in various cell types, including REFs, MuSCs, and\nNSCs, promotes shallow quiescence away from the transition to senescence [16,18,58].Biomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 4 of 8\n\nTogether, the ﬁndings above highlight the lysosome–autophagy axis as a central trigger of\nquiescence deepening and the quiescence-to-senescence transition.\n3.2. Controller: The Rb–E2F Switch Threshold\nOur earlier studies demonstrated that the Rb–E2F pathway, a pivotal regulator of the\ncell cycle in animals and plants [59–63], functions as a bistable toggle switch [64,65]. This\nRb–E2Fswitch converts graded and transient mitogen signals into a binary (OFF/ON)\nactivity of E2F (representing the combined E2F transcriptional activators, E2F1-3a), which\nunderlies the all-or-none quiescence-to-proliferation transition [27,64,65]. The activation\nthreshold of the Rb–E2F switch, “Rb–E2F switch threshold” for short, controls quies-\ncence depth: increasing or decreasing this threshold drives cells to deeper and shallower\nquiescence, respectively [27,28,66]. The Rb–E2F switch threshold is deﬁned as the min-\nimum growth stimulus required to activate the cellular E2F level to exceed that of non-\nphosphorylated Rb, which binds to and inhibits E2F in quiescent cells [27,28,66]. We have\nshown that the Rb–E2F switch threshold can be modulated by multiple factors in the\nRb–E2F pathway with varying degrees of sensitivity with those associated with G1 cyclins\nand cyclin-dependent kinases (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
