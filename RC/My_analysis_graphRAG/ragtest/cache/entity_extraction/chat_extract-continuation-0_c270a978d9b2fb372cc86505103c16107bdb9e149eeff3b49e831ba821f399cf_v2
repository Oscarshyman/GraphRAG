Recent studies have shown that quiescence is not a passive andhomogeneous state but actively maintained and heterogeneous. These cellularcharacteristics associated with quiescence were observed primarily in cultured cellsunder a static medium. However, cellsin vivoface different microenvironmentalconditions, particularly, under interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows distributed through extracellularmatrices. Interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow exerts shear stress on cells and matrix strain, and resultsin continuous replacement of extracellular factors. In this study, we analyzed individual cellsunder varying/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rates in micro/uniFB02uidic devices. We found quiescence characteristicspreviously identi/uniFB01ed under conventional static medium, including serum signal-dependantquiescence entry and exit and time-dependant quiescence deepening, are also presentunder continuous/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, increasing the/uniFB02ow rate drives cells to shallowerquiescence and become more likely to reenter the cell cycle upon growth stimulation. Thiseffect is due to/uniFB02ow-induced physical and biochemical cues. Speci/uniFB01cally, increasing shearstress or extracellular factor replacement individually, without altering other parameters,results in shallow quiescence. We show our experimental results can be quantitativelyexplained by a mathematical model connecting extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow to an Rb-E2f bistableswitch that regulates the quiescence-to-proliferation transition. Our/uniFB01ndings uncover apreviously unappreciated mechanism that likely underlies the heterogeneous responses ofquiescent cells for tissue repair and regeneration in different physiological tissuemicroenvironments.\nKeywords: cellular quiescence, quiescence depth, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow,/uniFB02ow shear stress, extracellular factors,microenvironment, micro/uniFB02uidics, mathematical model\nINTRODUCTION\nQuiescence is a dormant, non-proliferative cellular state. Quiescent cells, however, still maintain thepotential to proliferate upon physiological signals, making them distinct from other dormant cellsthat are irreversibly arrested, such as those in senescence or terminal differentiation. Activatingquiescent cells (e.g., adult stem and progenitor cells) to proliferate is fundamental to tissuehomeostasis and repair (Coller et al., 2006;Wilson et al., 2008;Li and Clevers, 2010;Cheungand Rando, 2013). Quiescence has long been viewed as a passive cellular state lacking cell cycle\nEdited by:Weimin Li,Washington State University,United StatesReviewed by:Diane Alicia de Zélicourt,University of Zurich, SwitzerlandTaeko Kobayashi,Kyoto University, Japan*Correspondence:Linan Jiangjiangl@arizona.eduGuang Yaoguangyao@arizona.edu\n†These authors have contributedequally to this workSpecialty section:This article was submitted toCell Growth and Division,a section of the journalFrontiers in Cell and DevelopmentalBiologyReceived:11 October 2021Accepted:08 February 2022Published:24 February 2022Citation:Liu B, Wang X, Jiang L, Xu J, Zohar Yand Yao G (2022) Extracellular FluidFlow Induces Shallow QuiescenceThrough Physical andBiochemical Cues.Front.

Recent studies, however, have revealed that quiescence israther actively maintained and highly heterogeneous (Colleret al., 2006;Sang et al., 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013;Spencer et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2017).The heterogeneity of quiescent cells in their proliferationpotential can be described as a graded depth. Cells in deeperquiescence require stronger growth stimulation and take longerto exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle than in shallowerquiescence (Augenlicht and Baserga, 1974;Kwon et al., 2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019). Hepatocytes in older rats are an example ofdeeper quiescent cells, displaying a longer delay before reenteringthe cell cycle and reinitiating DNA replication following partialhepatectomy, as compared to those in younger rats (Bucher,1963). Certain muscle and neural stem cells after tissue injury areexamples of shallow quiescent\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BI
