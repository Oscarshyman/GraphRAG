When we applied the quiescence-depth gene signature\nof REF cells to the RNA-seq data corresponding to NSCs before\n\nand after neural injury, we obtained quiescence depth scores\n\n(QDS) from the linear regression model (see\n\nMaterials and\n\nMethods\n\nfor details) to indicate the relative quiescence depth of\n\nNSCs. We found that the QDS of primed NSCs after injury was\nsignificantly smaller (i.e., shallower quiescence) than that of\ndormant NSCs before injury (Fig. 7\n\nA\n). This result suggests that\n\nthe quiescence-depth signature of REF cells in vitro can predict\nthe relative quiescence depth of NSCs in vivo, indicating that this\n\ngene signature may reflect shared quiescence regulatory mech-\n\nanisms across different cell types.\n\nTo test case S, we analyzed RNA-seq datasets associated with\n\ncellular senescence and aging by applying the QDS model with\nthe quiescence-depth gene signature of REF cells. Strikingly, we\nfound that QDS correctly predicted cellular senescence and ag-\ning in a wide array of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo\n\n(22, 23) (Fig. 7\n\nB\n–\nD\n). In all 6 cell lines (BJ, IMR-90, WI-38,\n\nHFF, MRC-5, and MDAH041) studied under replicative se-\nnescence and in all 3 conditions (Adriamycin, 5-aza, and H2O2)\nstudied under stress-induced senescence, QDS was significantly\nlarger than that in proliferating controls (Fig. 7\n\nB\n). Notably, QDS\n\nwas constructed without involving proliferating samples (by\n\ncomparing shallow and deep quiescent cells under 2- to 16-d\n\nserum starvation) and thus likely reflects a common feature\n\nbetween deep quiescence and senescence. Consistently, a set of\n\n\n“\n\nsenescence core signature\n”\ngenes identified from metaanalysis\n\n(19) exhibit similar expression changes (i.e., up- or down-regulation)\n\nunder both deep quiescence and senescence (Fig. 7\n\nE\n). Further-\n\nmore, QDS was found significantly larger in aged hematopoietic\nstem cells (Fig. 7\n\nC\n) and monotonically increasing in all 11\n\nstudied rat organs undergoing agi\nng processes from juvenile to\n\nadolescence, adult, and aged stages (Fig. 7\n\nD\n). The success of\n\nQDS gene signature to predict both senescence in vitro and aging\n\nin vivo suggests that quiescence deepening may share a molecular\nmechanistic basis with and act as a transitional state toward se-\n\nnescence and aging (see more in\n\nDiscussion\n). Consistently, it was\n\nrecently reported that long-term cultured quiescent human fi-\nbroblasts eventually transit into senescence under physiological\n\noxygen conditions (45).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nThe lysosome\n\n–\nautophagy pathway is known to protect adult stem\n\ncells against irreversible states, such as senescence, apoptosis,\n\n\n\n\n\nAB C\n\nD\n E\n\nFig. 7.\n\nQuiescence deepening parallels cellular senescence in vitro and aging in vivo.
