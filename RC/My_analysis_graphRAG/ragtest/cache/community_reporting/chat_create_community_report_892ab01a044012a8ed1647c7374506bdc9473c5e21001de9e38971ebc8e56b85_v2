It is characterized by a reversible cellular dormancy that can persist over prolonged periods, allowing cells to enter a state of inactivity without undergoing irreversible arrest. This state is often induced by conditions such as serum starvation and is influenced by various external factors.\n\nDuring quiescence, cells are metabolically inactive and do not actively divide; however, they retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle in response to specific growth signals or under certain conditions. This capacity for reactivation is essential for tissue regeneration and maintenance. Quiescence is also linked to aging and senescence, highlighting its significance in the broader context of cellular health and longevity.\n\nResearch into quiescence includes its effects on lysosomal function, as this state of dormancy can impact cellular processes and overall tissue dynamics.
