This deprivation leads to a state of quiescence, where cells exhibit reduced activity and altered cell cycle reentry. The absence of serum, which contains essential growth factors and nutrients, results in changes in gene expression and cellular responses. Serum starvation is commonly employed in research to analyze the adaptive responses of cells over time and to induce quiescence for specific durations in cell culture studies.

Quiescence is a state that cells enter as a direct result of serum starvation, indicating a significant relationship between the two. When cells experience serum starvation, they undergo a process that induces quiescence, leading them to enter a dormant state. This state of dormancy can vary in depth, with serum starvation potentially inducing deeper states of dormancy in cells.
