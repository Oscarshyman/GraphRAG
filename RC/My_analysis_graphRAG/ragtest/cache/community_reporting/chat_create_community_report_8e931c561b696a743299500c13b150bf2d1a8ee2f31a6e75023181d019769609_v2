This phenomenon is closely associated with aging and can be influenced by various factors, including the depth of quiescence and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Senescence can be triggered by stress and damage, effectively preventing further cell proliferation. It may also occur following prolonged periods of quiescence. The process results in cells losing their ability to divide and function, which is often discussed in the context of aging and cellular damage, as well as the effects of prolonged lysosomal inhibition.
