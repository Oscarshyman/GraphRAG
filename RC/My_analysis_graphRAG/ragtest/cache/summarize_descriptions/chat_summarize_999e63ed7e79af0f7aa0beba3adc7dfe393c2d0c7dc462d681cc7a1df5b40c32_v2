This deprivation leads to a state of quiescence, where cells exhibit reduced activity and altered cell cycle reentry. The absence of serum, which contains essential growth factors and nutrients, results in changes in gene expression and cellular responses. Serum starvation is commonly employed in research to analyze the adaptive responses of cells over time and to induce quiescence for specific durations in cell culture studies. Overall, serum starvation serves as a crucial method for understanding cellular behavior under nutrient-limited conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1738174937, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_bd83329f63", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
