The balance between cell quiescence and proliferation is fundamental to tissue physiologyand homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that quiescence is not a passive andhomogeneous state but actively maintained and heterogeneous. These cellularcharacteristics associated with quiescence were observed primarily in cultured cellsunder a static medium. However, cellsin vivoface different microenvironmentalconditions, particularly, under interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows distributed through extracellularmatrices. Interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow exerts shear stress on cells and matrix strain, and resultsin continuous replacement of extracellular factors. In this study, we analyzed individual cellsunder varying/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rates in micro/uniFB02uidic devices. We found quiescence characteristicspreviously identi/uniFB01ed under conventional static medium, including serum signal-dependantquiescence entry and exit and time-dependant quiescence deepening, are also presentunder continuous/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, increasing the/uniFB02ow rate drives cells to shallowerquiescence and become more likely to reenter the cell cycle upon growth stimulation. Thiseffect is due to/uniFB02ow-induced physical and biochemical cues. Speci/uniFB01cally, increasing shearstress or extracellular factor replacement individually, without altering other parameters,results in shallow quiescence. We show our experimental results can be quantitativelyexplained by a mathematical model connecting extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow to an Rb-E2f bistableswitch that regulates the quiescence-to-proliferation transition. Our/uniFB01ndings uncover apreviously unappreciated mechanism that likely underlies the heterogeneous responses ofquiescent cells for tissue repair and regeneration in different physiological tissuemicroenvironments.

INTRODUCTION
Quiescence is a dormant, non-proliferative cellular state. Quiescent cells, however, still maintain thepotential to proliferate upon physiological signals, making them distinct from other dormant cellsthat are irreversibly arrested, such as those in senescence or terminal differentiation. Activatingquiescent cells (e.g., adult stem and progenitor cells) to proliferate is fundamental to tissuehomeostasis and repair (Coller et al., 2006;Wilson et al., 2008;Li and Clevers, 2010;Cheungand Rando, 2013). Quiescence has long been viewed as a passive cellular state lacking cell cycle

Recent studies, however, have revealed that quiescence israther actively maintained and highly heterogeneous (Colleret al., 2006;Sang et al., 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013;Spencer et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2017).The heterogeneity of quiescent cells in their proliferationpotential can be described as a graded depth. Cells in deeperquiescence require stronger growth stimulation and take longerto exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle than in shallowerquiescence (Augenlicht and Baserga, 1974;Kwon et al., 2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019). Hepatocytes in older rats are an example ofdeeper quiescent cells, displaying a longer delay before reenteringthe cell cycle and reinitiating DNA replication following partialhepatectomy, as compared to those in younger rats (Bucher,1963). Certain muscle and neural stem cells after tissue injury areexamples of shallow quiescent cells, primed to reenter the cellcycle faster upon the next damage (Rodgers et al., 2014;Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015). The dysregulation of cellular quiescencedepth can lead to disrupted tissue homeostasis, exhibiting eitheran insuf/uniFB01cient number of growing cells due to an abnormallydeep quiescence, or a depleted pool of quiescent stem andprogenitor cells due to an abnormally shallow quiescence(Orford and Scadden, 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013;Fujimaki and Yao, 2020).Although dormant and non-proliferative, quiescent cellsreside in and interact with dynamic microenvironments. Aparticular microenvironmental factor is the interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owing over tissue cells, which transports nutrients and otherdissolved molecules that in/uniFB02uence cellular activities (Jain,1987;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Freund et al., 2012;Yao et al.,2013). Interstitial/uniFB02ow also generates mechanical shear stresson cells, which affects cell morphology, migration, growth,and differentiation (Jain, 1987;Ng and Swartz, 2003;Tarbellet al., 2005;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Polacheck et al., 2011;Shirure et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2019). To date, though,cellular quiescence has been mostly studied in cell culturesunder static medium or in animal models without examiningthe effects of interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow. Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02
ow rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication
A micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow. To obtain suf/uniFB01cient numbers of cells for/uniFB02owcytometry analyses, a micro/uniFB02uidic device was designed featuringa straight channel 420/uni03BCm in height, 4 mm in width, and 4 cm inlength. The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold. The mold with features ofmicrochannel patterns was made in an aluminum block using acomputer numerical control (CNC) machine based on a 3DComputer-Aided Design (CAD). PDMS mixture, consisting of10:1 base and curing agent, was poured onto the mold. After airbubble removal from the mixture under vacuum, the PDMS wascured at 55
°C for 3 h. The cured PDMS substrate was then peeledoff the mold with formed microchannel grooves (Figure 1A).After punching inlet and outlet holes at the two ends of a channel,the PDMS microchannel was bonded with a glass slide followingoxygen plasma treatment of the bonding surfaces (Figure 1B).Next, a pair of inlet and outlet tubing adapters was assembled foreach device to connect the microchannel to the external/uniFB02owcontrol system. The device fabrication and packaging werecompleted with incubation at 55
°C for an hour to enhance thebonding strength (Figure 1C). Prior to experiments, themicro/uniFB02uidic devices were sterilized by/uniFB02owing ethanol throughthe microchannels, followed by UV irradiation for 1 h inside abiosafety hood. The inner surfaces of the microchannel werecoated with 2% (w/w)/uniFB01bronectin to enhance the adhesion of cellsto the bottom surface.
Flow Rate and Flow-Induced Shear Stress
The total volume of medium in a microdevice (including tubingat the inlet/outlet of the channel but not connectors,Figure 1C)isapproximately 140/uni03BCl, and the medium volume in themicro/uniFB02uidic channel alone is about 67 µl. In this study, acontinuous medium/uniFB02ow with a/uniFB01xed/uniFB02ow rate (5 or 20/uni03BCl/h)was fed into the channel to mimic the typical interstitial/uniFB02owvelocity in soft tissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007) unless otherwisenoted. Correspondingly, the/uniFB02ow rate, rather than the primingvolume, is used to characterize the/uniFB02ow effect. We also considerthe concentration of the bulk/uniFB02uid is uniform spatially, and localdiffusion and convection at the interfaces between the/uniFB02uid andcells can be neglected.Pressure-driven/uniFB02ow in a microchannel presents a non-uniform velocity pro/uniFB01le, which gives rise to shear stress. Theshear stress for a Newtonian/uniFB02uid is directly proportional to theproduct of the velocity gradient and/uniFB02uid viscosity. Assuming a 2-D parabolic velocity pro/uniFB01le in a microchannel with a rectangular

°C, and given the microchannel dimensions,W=4 mm andH= 420/uni03BCm, the shear stress is linearly proportional tothe/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate. Thus, the two/uniFB02ow rates used in this study,Q=5 and 20/uni03BCl/h, correspond to shear stress valuesτ

and 0.35 × 10−3dyne/cm2, respectively (Figure 1D).InEq. 1, for a/uniFB01xed/uniFB02ow rate and microchannel dimensions,wall shear stress is linearly proportional to the medium viscosity.Dextran (Sigma, D5251; ~ 500,000 average molecular weight) wasdissolved in the medium in various/uniFB01nal concentrations to obtaincorrespondingly various medium viscosities.Table 1summarizesthe resultant dextran-containing medium concentrations,viscosity at 37°C, and corresponding shear stress values for thetwo/uniFB02ow rates (Carrasco et al., 1989).
Cell Culture
REF/E23 cells used in this work were derived from rat embryonic/uniFB01broblasts REF52 cells as a single-cell clone containing a stablyintegrated E2f1 promoter-driven destabilized GFP reporter (E2f-GFP for short), as previously described (Yao et al., 2008). Cellswere maintained at 37
°C with 5% CO2in the growth medium:DMEM (Coning, 15013-CV supplemented with 2x Glutamax(Gibco, 35050)) containing 10% bovine growth serum BGS(HyClone, SH30541.03).
Quiescence Depth Measurement UnderExtracellular Fluid Flow
To induce cellular quiescence, growing cells were trypsinized(Coning, 25052-CI), and 70/uni03BCl of cell suspension (0.6 millioncells/ml) was seeded into a micro/uniFB02uidic channel; after cell

Liu et al.Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescenceattachment on the bottom surface of the channel overnight,growth medium inside the channel was replaced by acontinuous/uniFB02ow of serum-starvation medium (0.02% BGS inDMEM) at a designated/uniFB02ow rate controlled by a programmablesyringe pump (Harvard PHD 2000). Cell morphologies werefound comparable across the/uniFB02ow rate range (0–20/uni03BCl/h)(Supplementary Figure S1A). To induce quiescence exit,following serum starvation, the microdevice was disconnectedfrom the/uniFB02ow-feeding setup (syringe and pump), and serum-stimulation medium (1–4% BGS in DMEM) was gently/uniFB02owedinto the micro-chamber using a pipette and a tip at the inlettubing of the device. The medium change step is fast (<1 min for140 µl medium) and identical to all quiescent cell groups,avoiding the bias in the exposure time of cells to thestimulation medium (if otherwise using slow/uniFB02ows at different/uniFB02ow rates, 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h). Cells were then incubated with serum-stimulation medium at static condition (again, identical to allquiescent cell groups). After 26 h of serum stimulation, cellsinside the channel were harvested, and the intensities of E2f-GFP signals from individual cells were measured using a/uniFB02owcytometer (BD LSR II). Flow cytometry data were analyzed usingFlowJo software (version 10.0).The percentage of cells with the E2f at the“On”state (E2f-On%) in a cell population after serum stimulation was used as anindex for quiescence depth before stimulation: the smaller theE2f-On%, the deeper the quiescence depth prior to serumstimulation (Kwon et al., 2017). Consistent with our previousstudies in static-medium experiments (Kwon et al., 2017;Wanget al., 2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019), E2f-On% was foundcomparable to the percentage of cells with EdU incorporation(EdU+%) in the micro/uniFB02uidic experiments under continuous/uniFB02ows (Supplementary Figures S1B,C). In the EdUincorporation assay, 1 µM EdU was added to the serum-stimulation medium at 0 h, and the EdU signal intensity wasmeasured 30 h after serum stimulation by the Click-iT EdU assayfollowing the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher, C10634).
Mathematical Modeling and StochasticSimulations
To account for the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on quiescencedepth, the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow-associated terms were added to the serumresponse terms in our previously established Rb-E2F bistableswitch model (Supplementary Table S1)(Yao et al., 2008). Basedon the resultant ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework(Supplementary Table S1), a Langevin-type stochasticdifferential equation (SDE) model was constructed as follows(Gillespie, 2000;Lee et al., 2010):X

The E2f-On state was de/uniFB01ned as the E2fmolecule number at the 26th h after serum stimulation reachingbeyond a threshold value of 300. All SDEs were implemented andsolved in Matlab.
RESULTSQuiescence Induction and Deepening OverTime are Consistent With or WithoutMedium Flow
To test whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellularquiescence, we cultured REF/E23 cells in micro/uniFB02uidic devicesunder medium/uniFB02ow (Figure 1). Two/uniFB02ow rates (Q= 5 and 20/uni03BCl/h) were used in this study; they generated average velocities of0.82 and 3.33/uni03BCm/s on the micro/uniFB02uidic platform, respectively,which are on the order of typical interstitial/uniFB02ow velocity in softtissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007). Cells were seeded inmicro/uniFB02uidic devices, and cell quiescence and proliferationstatus were assessed using a previously established and stablyintegrated E2f-GFP reporter (Yao et al., 2008), which wasvalidated by standard EdU-incorporation assay in regular cellcultures (Kwon et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2017;Fujimaki et al.,2019) as well as here on the micro/uniFB02uidic platform(Supplementary Figures S1B,C; see Methods).To induce quiescence, cells in micro/uniFB02uidic devices werecultured in serum-starvation medium (0.02% serum) for4 days under a given extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow (5 or 20/uni03BCl/h). Inthese conditions, about 95% of cells or more entered quiescence(Figures 2A,B, 0.02% serum, 4-days), as indicated by the Off-state of the E2f-GFP reporter (E2f-Off for short, the lower/leftmode of the E2f-GFP histograms inFigure 2). Quiescent cellswere subsequently stimulated to reenter the cell cycle with serumat varying concentrations (without/uniFB02ow, see Methods for details).Cells were harvested after 26 h of serum stimulation, and the E2f-GFP reporter activity was measured by/uniFB02ow cytometry. Withincreasing serum conconcentrations (0.02–4% serum, 4 days,Figure 2), higher percentages of cells exited quiescence andreentered the cell cycle, as indicated by the On-state of theE2f-GFP reporter (E2f-On for short, the higher/right mode ofthe E2f-GFP histograms inFigure 2). The observations that cellsentered quiescence upon serum deprivation under anextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow and then reentered the cell cycle upon

Liu et al.Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescenceserum stimulation are consistent with the cell behaviors inconventional static medium (Coller et al., 2006;Yao et al., 2008).We next compared cells induced to quiescence by 8vs. 4 daysof serum starvation in the presence of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow.Previous work, including ours, showed that cells moved intodeeper quiescence when they remained quiescent for longerdurations in conventional static-medium cell cultures(Augenlicht and Baserga, 1974;Owen et al., 1989;Kwon et al.,2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019). One may wonder, however, whetherthis phenotype was caused by the gradual depletion of nutrientsin the static culture mediumin vitro,which may behavedifferentlyin vivounder an interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow replenishingnutrients. In the micro/uniFB02uidic platform under a constant/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow(either 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h) during serum starvation, we found cells thatremained quiescent for a longer period of time (8 days) entered adeeper quiescent state and became less likely to exit: they had asmaller E2f-On% upon a given serum stimulation than those thatremained quiescent for a shorter time (4 days,Figure 2).Together, these results showed that cellular behaviors in 1)serum signal-dependant quiescence entry and exit and 2)quiescence deepening over time are consistent regardlesswhether cells are in micro/uniFB02uidic devices exposed toextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows or in conventional static-mediumcultures.
Fast Extracellular Fluid Flow Results inShallow Quiescence
To examine whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow may affectcellular quiescence depth, we compared the cells induced toquiescence by serum starvation under different medium/uniFB02owrates but otherwise in the same conditions. Speci/uniFB01cally, cells inmicro/uniFB02uidic devices were cultured in serum-starvation medium(0.02% serum) for 4 days under an extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow (0, 5, or20/uni03BCl/h); serum-starvation medium was then replaced by serum-stimulation medium (1–4% serum) using a pipette—this mediumchange procedure in each micro/uniFB02uidic device was completedwithin 1 min (compared to otherwise more than 20 and 5 h undera pump-driven slow/uniFB02ow of 5 and 20/uni03BCl/h, respectively); cells werethen cultured in static medium during serum stimulation. Thisidentical serum-stimulation condition was applied in this study(see Methods for details), so that the subsequent cell cycle reenter

Liu et al.Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescenceand thus the assessment of quiescence depth were not biased bydifferent effective exposure time of cells to the serum-stimulationmedium (if the medium was fed by different pump-driven/uniFB02ows)and thus comparable across different quiescent cell groups (whichwere induced by serum starvation under different medium/uniFB02owrates).Upon serum stimulation (with 1, 2, or 4% serum), the fractionof cells reentering the cell cycle from quiescence, as indicated byE2f-On% inFigure 3, were positively correlated with the medium/uniFB02ow rate applied to cells during quiescence induction (serumstarvation). These results suggest that a higher extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate leads to shallower quiescence, from which cells are morelikely to reenter the cell cycle upon stimulation.
Mechanical Shear Stress Drives ShallowQuiescence
Fluid/uniFB02ow introduces two types of cues to cells: 1) hydrodynamicshear stress (physical cue), and 2) continuous replenishment ofnutrients and other compounds dissolved in the/uniFB02uid andremoval of local cell-secreted substances (collectively asextracellular factor replacement; biochemical cue). Todetermine whether these physical and biochemical cues actagonistically or antagonistically (thereby potentiating orattenuating the combined effect) in affecting cellularquiescence depth, we next conducted experiments to delineatethe effect of each of the two cues.To isolate the effect of mechanical shear stress from that ofextracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth, theviscosity of the culture medium was varied while its/uniFB02ow rate (andthus the pace of extracellular/uniFB02uid replacement) was maintainedat a constant level. The/uniFB02ow-induced shear stress is linearlyproportional to the viscosity of working/uniFB02uid (Eq. 1), whichcan be manipulated by varying the amount of high-molecular-weight dextran dissolved in the medium (Table 1).Accordingly, REF/E23 cells were/uniFB01rst induced to quiescence byculturing them in the serum-starvation medium containing 0, 25,50, or 100 mg/ml high molecular weight ( ~ 500,000) dextran,respectively, for 4 days under 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h/uniFB02ow rate. The cells werethen stimulated with 2% or 4% serum for 26 h, and the fraction ofcells that exited quiescence (E2f-On%) was measured. As showninFigures 4A,B, E2f-On% increased with increasing dextranconcentration in the serum-starvation medium under either 5 or20/uni03BCl/h/uniFB02ow rate. By contrast, cells cultured in static serum-starvation medium containing the same higher dextranconcentration entered deeper rather than shallower quiescence(Supplementary Figure S2; see Discussion). These results suggestthat the dextran-induced shallow quiescence in the presence ofextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow was primarily due to the viscosity-dependent shear stress (instead of other dextran-associatedeffects such as being a metabolic source). The higher dextranconcentration, thus higher viscosity, of the medium/uniFB02owgenerates higher shear stress under a continuous/uniFB02ow rate (5or 20/uni03BCl/h, seeTable 1; but not static 0/uni03BCl/h). Put together, ourresults showed that increasing only the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow shear stress,while keeping the same/uniFB02ow rate and pace of extracellular factorreplacement, leads to shallower quiescence.
Extracellular Factor Replacement DrivesShallow Quiescence
The effect of continuous extracellular factor replacement oncellular quiescence depth was examined next. Some of theextracellular factors (such as nutrients) are expected to

Liu et al.Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescencefacilitate quiescence exit and cell cycle reentry, while others mayplay inhibitory roles (such as certain extracellular matrix (ECM)factors secreted by/uniFB01broblasts). To assess the net effect ofextracellular factor replacement, while decoupling it from theeffect of mechanical shear stress, we set up two testcon/uniFB01gurations. In the/uniFB01rst“recycled-medium”con/uniFB01guration, atotal/uniFB02uid volume of eitherV= 120 or 480/uni03BCl oscillated back-and-forth through the microchannel at a constant/uniFB02ow rate of eitherQ= 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h, respectively. Thus, when the/uniFB02ow direction wasswitched every 24 h, the complete/uniFB02uid volumeVpassed throughthe microchannel once. In the second“fresh-medium”con/uniFB01guration, the/uniFB02uid oscillated exactly as in the/uniFB01rstcon/uniFB01guration, but fresh medium of volumeVwas supplied toreplace previous medium at each/uniFB02ow direction switch. In boththe recycled-medium and fresh-medium experiments, cells wereserum-starved for 4 days at a given/uniFB02ow rateQ(5 or 20/uni03BCl/h) andsubsequently stimulated with serum (1 and 2%, respectively)for 26 h.The quiescence depth measurements are shown inFigure 5.The fractions of cells exiting quiescence and reentering cell cycle(E2f-On%) were signi/uniFB01cantly higher in‘fresh-medium’than in“recycled-medium”at a given serum stimulation condition.These results were obtained at the same/uniFB02ow rate (either 5 or20/uni03BCl/h) and thus under the same mechanical shear stress. Thedifference that the cells experienced was medium replacement:once per 24 h during the 4-days serum-starvation in the fresh-medium con/uniFB01guration, whereas no medium replacement duringthe same period in the recycled-medium con/uniFB01guration. Theseresults suggest that with the/uniFB02ow rate and shear stress being equal,extracellular factor replacement alone (as in“fresh-medium”)induces shallower quiescence than without such a replacement(as in“
recycled-medium”).
A Dynamic Model of Extracellular Fluid FlowRegulating Quiescence Depth
We next sought to develop a mathematical model to gainpotential mechanistic insight into the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth. Previously, we haveshown that the Rb-E2f pathway functions as a bistable gene-

Liu et al.Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescencenetwork switch that converts graded and transient serum growthsignals into an all-or-none transition from quiescence toproliferation (Yao et al., 2008;Yao et al., 2011). Speci/uniFB01cally,the minimum serum concentration required to activate this Rb-E2f bistable switch (the E2f-activation threshold for short)determines quiescence depth (Yao, 2014;Kwon et al., 2017).The experimental results in this study suggested that extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow generates or changes physical (mechanical shear stress)and biochemical (extracellular substances) cues that drive cells toshallow quiescence. We hypothesized that these/uniFB02ow-associatedcues boost the cellular responses to serum growth signals andthereby reduce the serum level required to activate the Rb-E2fbistable switch, which results in shallow quiescence.Accordingly, our previously established mathematical modelof the Rb-E2f bistable switch (Yao et al., 2008) was extended,incorporating the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow effects (FR) into theserum signal terms in the governing ordinary differentialequations (ODEs) (Supplementary Table S1). The augmentedmodel was utilized to simulate the responses (E2f-On or -Off) ofcells to serum stimulation under the in/uniFB02uence of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow varying in rate. The simulations were carried outfollowing the chemical Langevin formulation of the ODEframework, which considered both intrinsic and extrinsicnoise in the system (see Methods for detail), and the resultsare shown inFigure 6.A direct comparison betweenFigure 3BandFigure 6Ademonstrates that the simulation results, based on the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow-incorporated Rb-E2f bistable switch model, arequalitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with theexperimental measurements. This/uniFB01nding supports ourhypothesis regarding how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow may sensitizecells to serum growth signals and activate the Rb-E2f bistableswitch, and thus, reduces quiescence depth. Simulation resultsfurther show that the effect of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow is morepronounced than that of mechanical shear stress alone inpromoting quiescence exit (E2f-On%,Figure 6B). The“delta”between the two curves (orange minus blue) presumably re/uniFB02ectsthe effect of extracellular factor replacement in reducingquiescence depth (dotted grey curve,Figure 6B); this effectalso increases with a higher/uniFB02ow rate (thus, an increasing paceof/uniFB02uid replacement). Although how shear stress and extracellularfactor replacement promote quiescence exit is unknown, taking asimple assumption that shear stress and extracellular factorreplacement alone effectively corresponds to a portion (0.75

Liu et al.Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescenceand 0.85, respectively) of the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow term FR inthe model (Supplementary Table S1), the simulation results arereasonably (although not perfectly) consistent with theexperimental observations (regarding the shear stress effects,Supplementary Figure S3). Together, our modeling andexperimental results suggest that the/uniFB02ow-induced shear stress(physical cue) and replacement of extracellular factors(biochemical cues) contribute agnostically to the effect ofextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow in promoting quiescence exit bylowering the activation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.The good agreement between simulations and experimentsmotivated the application of the model for predicting the cellresponses to higher/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rates above 20 ul/h, under whichcells started to partially detach from the microchannel bottomsurface and hence excluded from the current experimental study.The simulation results show that the additive effect ofextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow to a given serum signal on quiescenceexit (E2f-On%) can be well/uniFB01tted with a Hill function (Figure 6C).Namely, E2f-On% increases monotonically with increasing/uniFB02owrate but is asymptotically bound by a serum concentration-dependent level. By contrast, with suf/uniFB01ciently high serumconcentration, the entire cell population can exit quiescence(i.e., E2f-On% approaches 100%) in our model even withoutextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow (Figure 6D). This latter result is consistentwith what we experimentally observed previously in REF/E23cells under static medium (Yao et al., 2008;Kwon et al., 2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019). Therefore, it appears that extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow facilitates quiescence exit by reducing the E2f-activationserum threshold, but unlikely to fully replace the role of serumgrowth factors in this process.
DISCUSSION
Quiescence is a reversible cellular dormancy state that canpersist over prolonged periods of time. The on-demandreactivation of quiescent cells to divide serves as the basisfor tissue homeostasis and repair (Coller et al., 2006;Wilsonet al., 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013). Thus far,characteristics of cellular quiescence have been mostly

Liu et al.Extracellular Flow Induces Shallow Quiescencestudied and discovered in conventional static-medium cellcultures, including the basic approaches applied to inducequiescence entry (e.g., serum deprivation, contact inhibition,and loss of adhesion) and exit (by reverting theaforementioned inducing signals). The microenvironmentexperienced by cultured cells under static medium,however, is different from that experienced by tissue cellsin vivowhere they are exposed to continuous interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows. The interstitial/uniFB02ow exerts hydrodynamic shear stresson cells due to/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow viscosity and shear strain rate; the/uniFB02ow also carries fresh nutrients along with dissolvedcompounds and removes local substances secreted by cells(Jain, 1987;Wiig, 1990;Wang and Tarbell, 1995;Ng andSwartz, 2003;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Shi and Tarbell, 2011;Freund et al., 2012;Galie et al., 2012). As such, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow is known to play a critical role in repairing andremolding tissues, such as the vascular, lung, and bone(Hillsley and Frangos, 1994;Liu et al., 1999;Louis et al.,2006;Rensen et al., 2007), through affecting cell morphology,adhesion, motility, metabolism, and differentiation(Yamamoto et al., 2005;Lutolf et al., 2009;Toh andVoldman, 2011;Hyler et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019).However, whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affectscellular quiescence remains unclear.In this study, a micro/uniFB02uidic platform is designed to mimic thephysiologically relevant interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow with varying rates(Figure 1) and investigate the/uniFB02ow effects on cellular quiescence.Experimental parameters, including/uniFB02ow rate,/uniFB02uid viscosity, and/uniFB02ow volume, were varied to test the effects of/uniFB02ow rate, shear stress,and extracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth.Our results show that,/uniFB01rst, several quiescence characteristicsidenti/uniFB01ed previously under static medium are also present undercontinuous/uniFB02
uid/uniFB02ow, including the serum signal-dependantquiescence entry and exit and the time-dependant quiescencedeepening (Figure 2). Second, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow sensitizescells to serum growth signals and thus leads to shallowquiescence. Particularly, increasing the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate reducesthe serum level needed for quiescence exit and cell cycle reentry.This result is likely due to the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow lowering theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch that controlsthe quiescence-to-proliferation transition (Yao et al., 2008;Kwonet al., 2017), as suggested by our model simulations (Figure 6). Ahigher/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate entails higher mechanical shear stress and afaster pace of extracellular factor replacement. These physical andbiochemical cues are able to drive cells into shallow quiescencewhen present either together (Figure 3) or separately (Figures 4,5). As a result, exposed to a faster extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow, cellsbecome more sensitive to serum growth signals and more likely toreenter the cell cycle.Several questions are left unanswered in our study. First, themolecular mechanisms are to be identi/uniFB01ed by which/uniFB02ow-inducedshear stress and extracellular factor replacement lower theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.Interestingly, increasing medium viscosity (by a higher dextranconcentration) promotes quiescence exit under a medium/uniFB02ow(Figure 4), but it inhibits quiescence exit in static medium(Supplementary Figure S2). This result may be associatedwith medium viscosity-induced changes in certain lipoproteinsynthesis (Yedgar et al., 1982), cytoskeleton and cell morphology(Khorshid, 2005), cell attachment and in/uniFB02ammation (Rouleauet al., 2010), or other cellular activities that inhibit quiescence exitin static medium. These changes, if also present under continuousmedium/uniFB02ow, appear to be surpassed by the effects of shear stressthat promote quiescence exit. The exact mechanism needs to beinvestigated in future studies. Additionally, quiescent cellscultured in the micro/uniFB02uidic device appear to be generallydeeper in quiescence than those cultured in well plates underotherwise the same conditions (e.g., comparing the E2f-On%upon 2% serum stimulation in microdevice (Figure 3) and that inthe comparable condition in well plate (Supplementary FigureS2), both being in static medium, 0/uni03BCl/h, and without addeddextran). We speculate this difference may be due to the differentsurfaces that cells were attached to (glass in the microchannelversusplastic in the well plate), or different medium height(<0.5 mm in the microchannelversus3–4 mm in the wellplate) that could result in different nutrient/factor availability,gas/heat exchange etc., or both. The exact mechanism needs to befurther investigated. Nevertheless, the current studydemonstrated, for the/uniFB01rst time to our best knowledge, thedirect effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow and its correspondingcomponents (shear stress and extracellular factor replacement)on cell quiescence depth.Individual quiescent cellsin vivo, including stem andprogenitor cells in their tissue niches, experience interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows with varying rates and viscosities depending onlocal tissue structures and distances from nearby blood vessels.The/uniFB02ow-driven heterogeneity in cellular quiescence depth, asdemonstrated in this study, may shed light on the heterogeneousresponses of quiescent cells in tissue repair and regeneration indifferent physiological contexts of living tissues.
