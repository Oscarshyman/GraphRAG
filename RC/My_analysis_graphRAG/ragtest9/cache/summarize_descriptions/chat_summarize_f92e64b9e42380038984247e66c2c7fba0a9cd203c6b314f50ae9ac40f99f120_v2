Cells cultured in static medium are observed to enter a deeper state of quiescence compared to those subjected to extracellular fluid flow. This suggests that the environmental conditions significantly affect the depth of quiescence that cells can achieve. Furthermore, static medium has been shown to inhibit the exit from quiescence, underscoring the critical role that these culture conditions play in regulating cellular dormancy. Overall, the relationship between QUIESCENCE and STATIC MEDIUM highlights the importance of environmental factors in cellular states and behaviors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061693, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
