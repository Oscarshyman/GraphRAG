These cells have the unique ability to enter a quiescent state, allowing them to remain inactive until needed for muscle regeneration. Upon tissue injury, MuSCs can rapidly transition from quiescence to an active state, entering the cell cycle to facilitate muscle repair. They exhibit different quiescent states in response to various stressors, including injury, and can eventually transition to senescence under prolonged stress conditions. Overall, MuSCs are essential for maintaining muscle integrity and function, demonstrating remarkable adaptability in their response to physiological demands.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061678, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
