REF cells serve as a valuable model for investigating the effects of various treatments on quiescence and senescence, thereby linking these two critical biological processes. Additionally, REF cells are utilized to explore the relationship between quiescence and oxidative stress, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying cellular aging. Notably, REF cells demonstrate changes in the depth of quiescence in response to serum starvation, further establishing them as a key model for studying the dynamics of quiescence. This comprehensive understanding of REF cells enhances the exploration of quiescence and its implications in aging and stress responses in cellular biology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061690, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 308, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
