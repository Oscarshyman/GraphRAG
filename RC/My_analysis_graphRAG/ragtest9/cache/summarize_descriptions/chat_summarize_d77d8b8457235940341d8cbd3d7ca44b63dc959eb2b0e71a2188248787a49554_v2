These cells are particularly valuable for studying the effects of serum starvation and extracellular fluid flow on both quiescence and the reentry of cells into the cell cycle. Through various experimental conditions, REF/E23 cells have been induced into a quiescent state, allowing researchers to explore how different extracellular factors, including serum concentration and fluid dynamics, influence the depth of quiescence. This research underscores the significance of REF/E23 cells in understanding the mechanisms underlying cellular dormancy and the factors that govern cell cycle regulation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061693, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 348, "total_tokens": 483, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
