In this state, cells exhibit heightened responsiveness to growth signals, making them more likely to reenter the cell cycle upon stimulation. This condition allows for a quicker transition back into active proliferation compared to deeper quiescence, where cells remain in a more prolonged and pronounced state of dormancy. Overall, shallow quiescence facilitates a more dynamic cellular response to environmental cues, promoting rapid reactivation of growth processes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061680, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 469, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
