Decreased lysosomal function is suggested to contribute to deep quiescence, as impaired lysosomal activity negatively impacts a cell's ability to reenter the cell cycle. Furthermore, deep quiescent cells display gene expression signatures that are similar to those of senescent cells, indicating a potential link between quiescence and lysosomal function. This relationship highlights the importance of lysosomal activity in maintaining cellular proliferation and the regulation of quiescent states.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061691, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 300, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
