EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) incorporation serves as a crucial method for quantifying the reentry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle, thereby providing insights into the depth of quiescence experienced by these cells. By measuring the percentage of cells that incorporate EdU, researchers can assess cell proliferation rates, which are influenced by the quiescent state of the cells. This relationship highlights the importance of EdU as a tool for elucidating the mechanisms governing cell cycle reentry and the biological implications of quiescence in various physiological and pathological contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061690, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 320, "total_tokens": 463, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
