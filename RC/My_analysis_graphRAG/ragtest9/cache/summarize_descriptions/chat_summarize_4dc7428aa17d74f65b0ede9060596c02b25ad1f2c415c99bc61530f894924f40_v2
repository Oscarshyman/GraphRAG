It governs both the entry and exit of cells from quiescence, thereby influencing their transition to senescence. Additionally, the Rb-E2F network facilitates the transition from quiescence to proliferation, functioning as a bistable switch that is responsive to external factors such as serum concentration and extracellular fluid flow.
