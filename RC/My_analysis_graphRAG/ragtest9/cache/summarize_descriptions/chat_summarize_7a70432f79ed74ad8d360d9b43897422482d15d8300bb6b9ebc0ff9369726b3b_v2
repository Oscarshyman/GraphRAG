This condition is often influenced by factors such as lysosomal function and is typically induced by environmental stresses, including serum starvation. During deep quiescence, cells enter a prolonged non-dividing phase, becoming less responsive to growth signals and external stimuli. Over time, this state may lead to a transition towards cellular senescence, further decreasing the likelihood of exiting quiescence. Overall, deep quiescence represents a critical aspect of cellular behavior, particularly in studies examining how cells respond to stress and maintain their viability in adverse conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061680, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 441, "total_tokens": 575, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
