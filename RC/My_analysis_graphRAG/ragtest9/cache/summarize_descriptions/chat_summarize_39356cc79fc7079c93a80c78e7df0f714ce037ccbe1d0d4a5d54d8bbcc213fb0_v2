This indicates a direct connection between lysosomal activity and the quiescent state. Specifically, lysosomal function plays a crucial role in regulating the depth of quiescence by mitigating oxidative stress, which in turn affects the proliferative potential of quiescent cells. Furthermore, lysosomes are involved in modulating the metabolic state and proliferative capacity of these cells. Research suggests that as cells transition into deeper states of quiescence, both lysosomal function and mass are significantly altered, underscoring the intricate relationship between lysosomes and quiescence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061690, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 487, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
