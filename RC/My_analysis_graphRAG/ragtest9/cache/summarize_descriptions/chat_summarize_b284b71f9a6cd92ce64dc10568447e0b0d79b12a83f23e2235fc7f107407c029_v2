Senescence biomarkers are critical tools in this context, as they are utilized to identify and quantify the presence of senescent cells, thereby establishing a direct link to the senescence process. Notably, the levels of these biomarkers tend to increase with the duration of cell-cycle withdrawal, suggesting a significant relationship between the presence of senescence biomarkers and the progression of cellular senescence. This relationship underscores the importance of senescence biomarkers in understanding the mechanisms of aging and their potential implications in biomedical research and therapeutic interventions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061690, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 425, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
