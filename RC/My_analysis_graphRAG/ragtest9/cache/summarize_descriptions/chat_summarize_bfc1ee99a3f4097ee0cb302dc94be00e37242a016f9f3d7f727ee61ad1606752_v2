They possess the remarkable ability to perform a variety of biological functions, which include entering states such as quiescence, senescence, and proliferation. Quiescence refers to a state of dormancy where cells are metabolically inactive but can reactivate and reenter the cell cycle when conditions are favorable. This versatility allows cells to adapt to different physiological conditions, ensuring the maintenance and continuity of life processes. Overall, cells are essential for the growth, development, and homeostasis of organisms, highlighting their critical role in biological systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061680, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 419, "total_tokens": 538, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
