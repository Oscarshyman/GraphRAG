In this state, cells are less responsive to growth signals and can be influenced by various external factors, including serum starvation, oxidative stress, shear stress, and extracellular fluid flow. Quiescent cells do not actively divide, which serves as a mechanism for tissue homeostasis and repair, enabling them to conserve resources and survive unfavorable conditions. This state is distinct from irreversible cell arrest, as quiescent cells retain the potential to re-enter the cell cycle upon receiving appropriate physiological signals. Overall, quiescence plays a critical role in cellular survival and adaptation to environmental changes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061678, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 933, "total_tokens": 1081, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
