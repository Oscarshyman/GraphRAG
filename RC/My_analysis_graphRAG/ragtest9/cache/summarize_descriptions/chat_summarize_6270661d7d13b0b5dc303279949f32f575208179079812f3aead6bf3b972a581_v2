The flow of extracellular fluid affects the depth of quiescence, with higher flow rates leading to shallower quiescence and an increased likelihood of cells reentering the cell cycle. This flow generates both physical and biochemical cues that directly influence the quiescence depth of cells. Additionally, extracellular fluid impacts the sensitivity of cells to serum growth signals, further modulating their ability to exit the dormant state. Overall, the interplay between extracellular fluid dynamics and cellular quiescence is crucial, as it provides essential cues that can either promote or inhibit the transition from quiescence to active cell cycling.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061692, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 536, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
