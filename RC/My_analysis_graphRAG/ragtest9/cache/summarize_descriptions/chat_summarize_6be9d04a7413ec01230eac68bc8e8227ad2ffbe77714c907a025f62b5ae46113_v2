It is utilized to induce and maintain quiescence in cells during static culture conditions, which impacts their metabolic state. Additionally, dextran has been shown to promote the exit from quiescence when cells are subjected to medium flow conditions. This dual functionality highlights dextran's influence on cellular states, making it a critical component in studies related to cell behavior and metabolism under varying environmental conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061693, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 103, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
