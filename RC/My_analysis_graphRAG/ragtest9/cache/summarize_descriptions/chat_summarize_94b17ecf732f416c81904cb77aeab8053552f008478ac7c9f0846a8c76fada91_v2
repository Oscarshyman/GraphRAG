This phenomenon is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, as WI-38 cells exhibit a characteristic growth pattern where their proliferation is inhibited when they reach a certain density. This mechanism not only regulates their growth in culture conditions but also plays a significant role in maintaining tissue integrity. Through the study of WI-38 cells, researchers can gain insights into the regulatory processes governing cell proliferation and the implications for tissue homeostasis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061690, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 308, "total_tokens": 418, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
