This process is crucial for inducing these cells to reenter the cell cycle, thereby enhancing their proliferation and metabolic activity. It is commonly employed in cell culture techniques to promote cell growth and assess the responsiveness of quiescent cells. By adding serum to the culture, researchers can effectively stimulate cell growth and facilitate the transition of cells from a quiescent state back into active division.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061682, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 105, "prompt_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 433, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
