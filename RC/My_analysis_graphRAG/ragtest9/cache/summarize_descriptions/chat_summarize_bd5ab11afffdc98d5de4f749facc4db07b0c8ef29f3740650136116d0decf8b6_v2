In the context of \"QUIESCENCE,\" EdU incorporation serves as a critical tool for assessing the dynamics of quiescent cells, which are in a state of temporary non-division. Specifically, EdU incorporation is utilized to measure the exit from quiescence, thereby indicating how responsive these quiescent cells are to growth signals when stimulated. Furthermore, the percentage of EdU-positive (EdU+) cells is employed to evaluate the entry of cells into the cell cycle, a process that is influenced by both the state of quiescence and various treatment conditions. This relationship highlights the importance of EdU in understanding the behavior of quiescent cells in response to external stimuli and their potential re-entry into active proliferation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061690, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 184, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
