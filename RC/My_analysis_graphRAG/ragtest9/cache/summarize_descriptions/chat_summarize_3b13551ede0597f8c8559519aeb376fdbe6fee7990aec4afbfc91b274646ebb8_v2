It has been observed that this type of stress can sensitize cells to serum growth signals, thereby promoting the exit from quiescence and influencing the depth of quiescence experienced by the cells. Additionally, the effects of mechanical shear stress on quiescence are modulated by the viscosity of the culture medium, indicating that the physical properties of the environment can further impact cellular responses. Overall, the interplay between mechanical shear stress and quiescence is crucial for understanding cell behavior in various physiological and pathological contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061693, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
