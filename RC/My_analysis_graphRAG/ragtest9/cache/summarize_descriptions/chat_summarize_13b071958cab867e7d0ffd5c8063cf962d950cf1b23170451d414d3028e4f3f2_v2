They possess the unique ability to enter a quiescent state, which is crucial for maintaining neural tissue homeostasis. NSCs can differentiate into various neural cell types, including neurons and glial cells, thereby playing a significant role in brain development, repair, and regeneration. Following tissue damage, these cells can rapidly reenter the cell cycle, demonstrating their capacity for self-renewal and their importance in responding to injury. Overall, neural stem cells are essential for both the maintenance and recovery of neural tissue, highlighting their potential in therapeutic applications for neurological conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061679, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 362, "total_tokens": 500, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
