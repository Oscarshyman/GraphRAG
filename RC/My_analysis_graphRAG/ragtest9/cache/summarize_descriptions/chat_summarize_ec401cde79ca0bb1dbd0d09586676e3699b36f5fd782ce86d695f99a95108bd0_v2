It has been observed that shear stress can induce shallow quiescence, which impacts the cells' ability to transition into a proliferative state. Furthermore, shear stress lowers the activation threshold of the Rb-E2F bistable switch, thereby affecting the depth of quiescence. This mechanical force not only influences the quiescent state but also promotes the exit from quiescence by facilitating cell reactivation. Overall, there is a direct relationship between shear stress and cellular quiescence, highlighting the importance of mechanical forces in regulating cellular states and transitions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061693, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 526, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
