Deep quiescence indicates a greater depth of cellular dormancy compared to shallow quiescence, characterized by a significant reduction in cellular activity. This state requires more time and a higher serum concentration for cells to reenter the cell cycle, suggesting that cells in deep quiescence are less likely to exit and reenter the cycle compared to those in shallower states of quiescence. Overall, deep quiescence reflects a more pronounced and stable form of cellular dormancy, emphasizing the intricate balance of cellular activity and inactivity in biological systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061690, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 473, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
