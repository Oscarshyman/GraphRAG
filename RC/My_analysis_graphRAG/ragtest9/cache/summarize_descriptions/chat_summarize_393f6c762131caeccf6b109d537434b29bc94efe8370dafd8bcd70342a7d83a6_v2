In this state, cells become less likely to re-enter the cell cycle, necessitating stronger stimuli for activation compared to less dormant quiescent states. Deep quiescence is distinct from cellular senescence, which is a different biological process. Cells in deep quiescence require longer durations and higher serum concentrations to resume cell cycle progression, indicating a profound level of dormancy that enhances their resistance to reactivation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061678, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 332, "total_tokens": 444, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
