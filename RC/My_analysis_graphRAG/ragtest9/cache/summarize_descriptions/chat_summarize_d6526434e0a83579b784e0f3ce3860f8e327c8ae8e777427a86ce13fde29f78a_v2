Serum provides essential growth factors that stimulate quiescent cells to exit their dormant state and re-enter the cell cycle. The stimulation by serum not only induces the exit from quiescence but also underscores the critical role of growth factors in managing cellular dormancy. Furthermore, the concentration of serum is pivotal in determining the depth of quiescence, as it activates the Rb-E2F bistable switch, which is necessary for the transition out of quiescence. Overall, the presence of serum is vital for activating cells from a quiescent state, emphasizing its significant role in promoting cellular activation and proliferation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744061693, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 487, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
