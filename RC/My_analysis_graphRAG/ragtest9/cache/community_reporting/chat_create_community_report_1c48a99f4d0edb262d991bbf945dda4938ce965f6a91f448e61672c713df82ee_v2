This mass can fluctuate based on various cellular conditions and metabolic states. Specifically, lysosomal mass may increase in response to stimuli such as serum starvation, which indicates a cellular adaptation to changing environmental conditions and metabolic demands. These changes in lysosomal mass are crucial for understanding cellular responses and adaptations in different physiological contexts.\",4\n26,DEEP QUIESCENCE,\"Deep quiescence is a specialized and more dormant state of cellular quiescence characterized by significantly decreased transcriptional activity and increased chromatin condensation. In this state, cells become less likely to re-enter the cell cycle, necessitating stronger stimuli for activation compared to less dormant quiescent states. Deep quiescence is distinct from cellular senescence, which is a different biological process. Cells in deep quiescence require longer durations and higher serum concentrations to resume cell cycle progression, indicating a profound level of dormancy that enhances their resistance to reactivation.\",19\n129,CELL PROLIFERATION,\"Cell proliferation is the process by which cells divide and reproduce, which is tightly regulated and can be influenced by the state of quiescence.\",2\n134,SERUM STARVATION,\"Serum starvation is a condition characterized by the deprivation of serum from cells, commonly employed in experimental settings to investigate various cellular responses. This condition induces quiescence, a state of reversible growth arrest, and significantly influences the cells' proliferative potential and metabolic state. Researchers utilize serum starvation to study the depth of quiescence and the associated changes in cellular behavior, including alterations in lysosomal mass and the activation of autophagy. By creating a nutrient-limited environment, serum starvation allows for controlled studies of cellular responses, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying growth, proliferation, and metabolic adaptations in cells.\",2\n138,LYSOSOMAL GENES,\"Lysosomal genes encode various enzymes and proteins that are involved in lysosomal function, and their expression increases as quiescence deepens.\",1\n156,BAFILOMYCIN A1,\"Bafilomycin A1 (Baf) is a lysosomal inhibitor that prevents lysosomal acidification, thereby impairing lysosomal function and affecting cellular processes.\",1\n198,PROTEIN AGGREGATES,\"Protein aggregates are clusters of misfolded proteins that can accumulate in cells, particularly during deep quiescence, and may affect cellular function and quiescence depth.\",1\n25,SHALLOW QUIESCENCE,\"Shallow quiescence is characterized as a less dormant state of cellular quiescence, wherein cells exhibit heightened responsiveness to growth signals. This state allows for a more facile transition back into the cell cycle, as cells in shallow quiescence are less profoundly quiescent compared to those in deeper states of dormancy. Consequently, these cells possess a greater tendency to resume proliferation upon the receipt of appropriate growth stimuli.\",3\n146,LYSOTRACKER,\"LysoTracker is a fluorescent dye specifically designed for staining lysosomes in live cells.
