This quiescence allows these cells to remain inactive for extended periods, which can ultimately contribute to cancer recurrence after a phase of dormancy. Their ability to escape treatment poses significant challenges in cancer management, as they can reactivate and lead to the resurgence of the disease even after initial successful treatment.\",2\n233,QUIESCENT HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS,\"Quiescent hematopoietic stem cells are a subset of stem cells that remain in a non-dividing state, allowing them to preserve their function and avoid exhaustion over time.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n200,OXIDATIVE STRESS,QUIESCENCE,\"Oxidative stress and quiescence are interrelated phenomena in cellular biology. Increasing oxidative stress is associated with a deepening of quiescence, suggesting that higher levels of oxidative stress lead to a more pronounced state of cellular dormancy. Conversely, reducing oxidative stress has the effect of preventing quiescence from deepening, indicating a potential mechanism by which cells can escape or mitigate the quiescent state. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between the degree of oxidative stress and the depth of quiescence in cells, reinforcing the notion that elevated oxidative stress contributes to a more profound quiescent state. This relationship highlights the critical role of oxidative stress in regulating cellular quiescence and suggests potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in conditions where quiescence is a factor.\",107\n285,DORMANT CANCER CELLS,OXIDATIVE STRESS,\"Dormant cancer cells can be influenced by oxidative stress, which may affect their survival and potential reactivation.\",8\n284,QUIESCENT HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS,OXIDATIVE STRESS,\"Quiescent hematopoietic stem cells can accumulate oxidative stress over time, which may impact their function and longevity.\",7\n\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}}
