However,\na comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic landscape changes during quiescence\ndeepening and the quiescence-to-senescence transition is still lacking, highlighting an\nimportant area for future research [40].\nThe heterogeneity and context dependency of the quiescence-to-senescence transition\nare also apparent, underscoring the complexity of these cellular processes. For instance,\nROS-mediated p16INK4aactivation occurs through epigenetic derepression in MuSCs [18]\nbut via p38 MAPK hyperactivation in HSPCs [14]. Blocking p16INK4aactivation prevents the\nquiescence-to-senescence transition only in a subset of cells [13], suggesting the involvement\nof other molecular effectors driving the quiescence-origin senescence. Furthermore, is\nlysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition\nto senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb–E2F switch threshold—or\npossibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream\nE2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]? Growing cells exiting from either\nthe G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle converge onto the same senescent state with a G1-like\nmolecular signature [76]. How about quiescence-origin senescence? What are its molecular\nmarkers, and to what extent do they overlap with or differ from the markers of proliferation-\norigin senescence, beyond the sustained (if not totally irreversible) arrested phenotype\n(Figure 1)? Future investigations are needed to ﬁnd the answers.\n4.
