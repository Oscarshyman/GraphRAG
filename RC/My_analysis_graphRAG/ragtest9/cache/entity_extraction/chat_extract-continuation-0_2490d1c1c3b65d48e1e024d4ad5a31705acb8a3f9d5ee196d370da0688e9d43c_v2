Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

Hepatocytes in older rats are an example ofdeeper quiescent cells, displaying a longer delay before reenteringthe cell cycle and reinitiating DNA replication following partialhepatectomy, as compared to those in younger rats (Bucher,1963). Certain muscle and neural stem cells after tissue injury areexamples of shallow quiescent cells, primed to reenter the cellcycle faster upon the next damage (Rodgers et al., 2014;Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015). The dysregulation of cellular quiescencedepth can lead to disrupted tissue homeostasis, exhibiting eitheran insuf/uniFB01cient number of growing cells due to an abnormallydeep quiescence, or a depleted pool of quiescent stem andprogenitor cells due to an abnormally shallow quiescence(Orford and Scadden, 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013;Fujimaki and Yao, 2020).Although dormant and non-proliferative, quiescent cellsreside in and interact with dynamic microenvironments. Aparticular microenvironmental factor is the interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owing over tissue cells, which transports nutrients and otherdissolved molecules that in/uniFB02uence cellular activities (Jain,1987;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Freund et al., 2012;Yao et al.,2013). Interstitial/uniFB02ow also generates mechanical shear stresson cells, which affects cell morphology, migration, growth,and differentiation (Jain, 1987;Ng and Swartz, 2003;Tarbellet al., 2005;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Polacheck et al., 2011;Shirure et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2019). To date, though,cellular quiescence has been mostly studied in cell culturesunder static medium or in animal models without examiningthe effects of interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow. Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow. To obtain suf/uniFB01cient numbers of cells for/uniFB02owcytometry analyses, a micro/uniFB02uidic device was designed featuringa straight channel 420/uni03BCm in height, 4 mm in width, and 4 cm inlength. The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold. The mold with features ofmicrochannel patterns was made in an aluminum block using acomputer numerical control (CNC) machine based on a 3DComputer-Aided Design (CAD). PDMS mixture, consisting of10:1 base and curing agent, was poured onto the mold. After airbubble removal from the mixture under vacuum, the PDMS wascured at 55\n°C for 3 h. The cured PDMS substrate was then peeledoff the mold with formed microchannel grooves (Figure 1A).After punching inlet and outlet holes at the two ends of a channel,the PDMS microchannel was bonded with a glass slide followingoxygen plasma treatment of the bonding surfaces (Figure 1B).Next, a pair of inlet and outlet tubing adapters was assembled foreach device to connect the microchannel to the external/uniFB02owcontrol system. The device fabrication and packaging werecompleted with incubation at 55\n°C for an hour to enhance thebonding strength (Figure 1C). Prior to experiments, themicro/uniFB02uidic devices were sterilized by/uniFB02owing ethanol throughthe microchannels, followed by UV irradiation for 1 h inside abiosafety hood. The inner surfaces of the microchannel werecoated with 2% (w/w)/uniFB01bronectin to enhance the adhesion of cellsto the bottom surface.\nFlow Rate and\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>CELL<|>Hepatocytes are the main functional cells of the liver, involved in various metabolic processes and known to exhibit different quiescence depths based on age and physiological conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLDER RATS<|>CELL<|>Older rats are used as a model organism to study the effects of aging on cellular processes, including the behavior of hepatocytes in quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNGER RATS<|>CELL<|>Younger rats serve as a comparison group in studies examining the differences in cellular quiescence and reentry into the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS<|>CELL<|>Muscle stem cells are a type of stem cell that can enter the cell cycle quickly after tissue injury, demonstrating shallow quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURAL STEM CELLS<|>CELL<|>Neural stem cells are capable of rapid reentry into the cell cycle following tissue damage, indicating a shallow quiescent state.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence depth refers to the state of dormancy in cells, which can vary from shallow to deep, affecting their ability to reenter the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS<|>MECHANISM<|>Tissue homeostasis is the balance of cell proliferation and quiescence necessary for maintaining healthy tissue function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROENVIRONMENT<|>MECHANISM<|>The microenvironment encompasses the surrounding conditions and factors that influence cellular behavior, including quiescence and activation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLUID<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLUID<|>Extracellular fluid is the fluid found outside of cells that provides a medium for nutrient transport and cellular communication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDRODYNAMIC SHEAR STRESS<|>MECHANISM<|>Hydrodynamic shear stress is the mechanical force exerted by fluid flow on cells, which can influence their morphology and behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>A microfluidic system is a technology used to manipulate small volumes of fluids, allowing for controlled studies of cellular behavior under various conditions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>OLDER RATS<|>Hepatocytes in older rats exhibit deeper quiescence, affecting their reentry into the cell cycle compared to younger rats.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS<|>NEURAL STEM CELLS<|>Both muscle and neural stem cells demonstrate shallow quiescence, allowing for rapid reentry into the cell cycle after injury.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH<|>TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS<|>The depth of quiescence in cells is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, as it regulates the balance between cell proliferation and dormancy.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROENVIRONMENT<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH<|>The microenvironment, including factors like extracellular fluid and shear stress, significantly influences the depth of cellular quiescence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLUID<|>HYDRODYNAMIC SHEAR STRESS<|>Extracellular fluid flow generates hydrodynamic shear stress, which can affect cellular morphology and quiescence depth.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH<|>The microfluidic system allows for the study of how extracellular fluid flow affects cellular quiescence depth in a controlled environment.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
