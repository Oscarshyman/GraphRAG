Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

Two/uniFB02ow rates (Q= 5 and 20/uni03BCl/h) were used in this study; they generated average velocities of0.82 and 3.33/uni03BCm/s on the micro/uniFB02uidic platform, respectively,which are on the order of typical interstitial/uniFB02ow velocity in softtissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007). Cells were seeded inmicro/uniFB02uidic devices, and cell quiescence and proliferationstatus were assessed using a previously established and stablyintegrated E2f-GFP reporter (Yao et al., 2008), which wasvalidated by standard EdU-incorporation assay in regular cellcultures (Kwon et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2017;Fujimaki et al.,2019) as well as here on the micro/uniFB02uidic platform(Supplementary Figures S1B,C; see Methods).To induce quiescence, cells in micro/uniFB02uidic devices werecultured in serum-starvation medium (0.02% serum) for4 days under a given extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow (5 or 20/uni03BCl/h). Inthese conditions, about 95% of cells or more entered quiescence(Figures 2A,B, 0.02% serum, 4-days), as indicated by the Off-state of the E2f-GFP reporter (E2f-Off for short, the lower/leftmode of the E2f-GFP histograms inFigure 2). Quiescent cellswere subsequently stimulated to reenter the cell cycle with serumat varying concentrations (without/uniFB02ow, see Methods for details).Cells were harvested after 26 h of serum stimulation, and the E2f-GFP reporter activity was measured by/uniFB02ow cytometry. Withincreasing serum conconcentrations (0.02–4% serum, 4 days,Figure 2), higher percentages of cells exited quiescence andreentered the cell cycle, as indicated by the On-state of theE2f-GFP reporter (E2f-On for short, the higher/right mode ofthe E2f-GFP histograms inFigure 2).

One may wonder, however, whetherthis phenotype was caused by the gradual depletion of nutrientsin the static culture mediumin vitro,which may behavedifferentlyin vivounder an interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow replenishingnutrients. In the micro/uniFB02uidic platform under a constant/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow(either 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h) during serum starvation, we found cells thatremained quiescent for a longer period of time (8 days) entered adeeper quiescent state and became less likely to exit: they had asmaller E2f-On% upon a given serum stimulation than those thatremained quiescent for a shorter time (4 days,Figure 2).Together, these results showed that cellular behaviors in 1)serum signal-dependant quiescence entry and exit and 2)quiescence deepening over time are consistent regardlesswhether cells are in micro/uniFB02uidic devices exposed toextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows or in conventional static-mediumcultures.\nFast Extracellular Fluid Flow Results inShallow Quiescence\nTo examine whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow may affectcellular quiescence depth, we compared the cells induced toquiescence by serum starvation under different medium/uniFB02owrates but otherwise in the same conditions.
