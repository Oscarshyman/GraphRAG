Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

Among them,\nDNA damage is a likely candidate, which can be caused by\n\nvarious stress signals (e.g., ROS and replication stress) and is\n\nassociated with quiescence entry (64, 65) as well as cellular se-\nnescence (66, 67) and aging (68, 69). Furthermore, many cellular\nactivities are up- or down-regulated as cells move deeper in\n\nquiescence (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n). Some of these cellular ac-\n\ntivities may be involved in the regulation of quiescence depth and\npotentially senescence and aging, with their detailed mechanisms\n\nawaiting further studies. In this regard, it has been shown recently\n\nin both NSCs and bacteria that the accumulation of protein ag-\ngregates is associated with quiescence deepening, and that the\nclearance of protein aggregates (by lysosomes in NSCs and by\n\nDnaK\n\n–\nClpB complex in bacteria) drives cells to shallower quies-\n\ncence and enhances their ability to reenter the cell cycle (39, 70).\nQuiescence entry and exit are regulated by the Rb-E2f-Cyclin/\nCdk gene network (71, 72) that functions as a bistable switch\n\n(25). How does the toggle switch-like nature of the Rb-E2f\n\npathway fit with the lysosomal dimmer switch? We speculate\nthat during quiescence exit, cells first move progressively into\nshallow quiescence and at a time point, the restriction point (73,\n\n74),\n\n“\nflip\n”\ninto the cell cycle by committing to proliferation; the\n\nwhole process acts like adjusting a sliding dimmer before activating\na toggle switch. In this regard, i\nt will be important to figure out\n\nwhether and how the lysosomal switch cross-talks with the Rb-E2f\n\nswitch in controlling quiescence\ndepth and exit in future studies.\n\nRelatedly, recent in vivo studies on muscle and neural stem\ncells generally invoke 2 quiescence state: 1 shallow (e.g., GAlertand primed quiescence) and 1 deep. Our findings that the gene-\nexpression signature we developed in the fibroblast model\n\n22632\n|\nwww.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915905116\n Fujimaki et al.\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA LIBRARY on October 25, 2024 from IP address 128.196.199.13.\n\nin vitro can correctly classify deep (dormant) and shallow (primed)\n\nNSCs in vivo (Fig. 7\n\nA\n) suggest a potential mechanistic link be-\n\ntween the quiescent states in vitro and in vivo. As such, we\n\npredict that quiescence depth in vivo is also continuous instead\nof binary. It is possible that different levels of injuries can cause\nvarying levels of quiescent states in vivo, which was not examined\n\npreviously but would be interesting to test in future studies. Fi-\n\nnally, in support of the continuous quiescence depth in vivo are\nthe earlier findings that in the liver after partial hepatectomy and\n\nin the salivary gland after isoproterenol stimulation, cells in in-\n\ncreasingly older rats took an increasingly longer time to initiate\nDNA synthesis, behaving like cells in increasing deeper quies-\ncence (10, 75).\n\nQuiescence is commonly believed to protect cells from irre-\n\nversible arrest, such as senescence. Our work suggests that this\nprotection declines in long-term quiescent cells and the gradual\nquiescence deepening likely represents a transition path from\n\ncell proliferation to senescence. Relatedly, the same Rb and p53\n\npathways appear to underlie both quiescence and senescence\n(76\n\n–\n79). Whether and how the lysosome\n–\nautophagy pathway\n\ninteracts with Rb and p53 pathways to regulate the transition\n\nfrom deep quiescence to senescence, and whether such a tran-\n\nsition is gradual following a continuum or abrupt as controlled by\nan ultrasensitive or bistable switch-like mechanism (80, 81), re-\n\nmain significant unanswered questions (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S1\nA\n).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nDetailed descriptions of RNA-seq and downstream data analysis and mod-\n\neling, modulation of lysosomal\n\n–\nautophagic function and lysosome bio-\n\ngenesis, assays for quiescence-depth, lysosomal mass and proteolytic activity,\n\nautophagy flux, mitochondrial ROS,\n\nβ\n-galactosidase activity, cell size, and\n\ncytotoxicity are provided in\n\nSI Appendix\n.\n\nCell Culture and Quiescence Induction.\n\nREFs used in this study are from a single-\n\ncell clone derived from REF52 cells and contain a stably integrated human\n\nE2F1 promoter-driven destabilized EGFP (E2f-GFP) reporter, as previously\n\ndescribed [i.e., REF/E23 cells (25, 82)] unless otherwise noted.
