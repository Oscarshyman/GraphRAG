Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

Together, our modeling andexperimental results suggest that the/uniFB02ow-induced shear stress(physical cue) and replacement of extracellular factors(biochemical cues) contribute agnostically to the effect ofextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow in promoting quiescence exit bylowering the activation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.The good agreement between simulations and experimentsmotivated the application of the model for predicting the cellresponses to higher/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rates above 20 ul/h, under whichcells started to partially detach from the microchannel bottomsurface and hence excluded from the current experimental study.The simulation results show that the additive effect ofextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow to a given serum signal on quiescenceexit (E2f-On%) can be well/uniFB01tted with a Hill function (Figure 6C).Namely, E2f-On% increases monotonically with increasing/uniFB02owrate but is asymptotically bound by a serum concentration-dependent level. By contrast, with suf/uniFB01ciently high serumconcentration, the entire cell population can exit quiescence(i.e., E2f-On% approaches 100%) in our model even withoutextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow (Figure 6D). This latter result is consistentwith what we experimentally observed previously in REF/E23cells under static medium (Yao et al., 2008;Kwon et al., 2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019). Therefore, it appears that extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow facilitates quiescence exit by reducing the E2f-activationserum threshold, but unlikely to fully replace the role of serumgrowth factors in this process.\nDISCUSSION\nQuiescence is a reversible cellular dormancy state that canpersist over prolonged periods of time. The on-demandreactivation of quiescent cells to divide serves as the basisfor tissue homeostasis and repair (Coller et al., 2006;Wilsonet al., 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013).
