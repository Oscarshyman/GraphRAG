Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

Speci/uniFB01cally,the minimum serum concentration required to activate this Rb-E2f bistable switch (the E2f-activation threshold for short)determines quiescence depth (Yao, 2014;Kwon et al., 2017).The experimental results in this study suggested that extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow generates or changes physical (mechanical shear stress)and biochemical (extracellular substances) cues that drive cells toshallow quiescence. We hypothesized that these/uniFB02ow-associatedcues boost the cellular responses to serum growth signals andthereby reduce the serum level required to activate the Rb-E2fbistable switch, which results in shallow quiescence.Accordingly, our previously established mathematical modelof the Rb-E2f bistable switch (Yao et al., 2008) was extended,incorporating the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow effects (FR) into theserum signal terms in the governing ordinary differentialequations (ODEs) (Supplementary Table S1). The augmentedmodel was utilized to simulate the responses (E2f-On or -Off) ofcells to serum stimulation under the in/uniFB02uence of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow varying in rate. The simulations were carried outfollowing the chemical Langevin formulation of the ODEframework, which considered both intrinsic and extrinsicnoise in the system (see Methods for detail), and the resultsare shown inFigure 6.A direct comparison betweenFigure 3BandFigure 6Ademonstrates that the simulation results, based on the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow-incorporated Rb-E2f bistable switch model, arequalitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with theexperimental measurements. This/uniFB01nding supports ourhypothesis regarding how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow may sensitizecells to serum growth signals and activate the Rb-E2f bistableswitch, and thus, reduces quiescence depth. Simulation resultsfurther show that the effect of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow is morepronounced than that of mechanical shear stress alone inpromoting quiescence exit (E2f-On%,Figure 6B). The“delta”between the two curves (orange minus blue) presumably re/uniFB02ectsthe effect of extracellular factor replacement in reducingquiescence depth (dotted grey curve,Figure 6B); this effectalso increases with a higher/uniFB02ow rate (thus, an increasing paceof/uniFB02uid replacement). Although how shear stress and extracellularfactor replacement promote quiescence exit is unknown, taking asimple assumption that shear stress and extracellular factorreplacement alone effectively corresponds to a portion (0.75\n\nFIGURE 5 |Extracellular factor replacement drive cells to shallow quiescence.
