-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

4. Conclusions
Unlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence
involves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously
understudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of
cells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837
 6 of 8

is expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells
in our tissues than previously realized.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence
transition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of
biomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative
medicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms
of quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular
markers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked
senescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.
