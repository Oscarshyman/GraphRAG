This state is marked by reduced transcription and increased resistance to cell cycle re-entry, often leading to a transition towards senescence. Deep quiescence represents a prolonged dormancy in cells, which is particularly evident in older organisms, and is associated with a longer delay before re-entering the cell cycle. Cells in deep quiescence are less responsive to growth signals and require stronger stimuli, such as higher serum concentrations, to reactivate and re-enter the cell cycle compared to those in shallow quiescence.
