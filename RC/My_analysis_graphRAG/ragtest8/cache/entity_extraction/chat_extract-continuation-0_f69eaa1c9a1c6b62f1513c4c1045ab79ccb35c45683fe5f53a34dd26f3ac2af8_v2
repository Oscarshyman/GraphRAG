Often referred to as the\n\nG0 state, quiescence is, however, not a uniform state but with graded\ndepth. Shallow quiescent cells exhibit a higher tendency to revert to\nproliferation than deep quiescent cells, while deep quiescent cells\n\nare still fully reversible under physiological conditions, distinct from\n\nsenescent cells. Cellular mechani\nsms underlying the control of quies-\n\ncence depth and the connection between quiescence and senescence\n\nare poorly characterized, representing a missing link in our under-\n\nstanding of tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Here we measured\ntranscriptome changes as rat embryonic fibroblasts moved from\nshallow to deep quiescence over time in the absence of growth\n\nsignals. We found that lysosomal gene expression was significantly\n\nup-regulated in deep quiescence, an\nd partially compensated for grad-\n\nually reduced autophagy flux. Reduc\ning lysosomal function drove\n\ncells progressively deeper into qui\nescence and eventually into a\n\nsenescence-like irreversibly arrested state; increasing lysosomal func-\n\ntion, by lowering oxidative stress\n, progressively pushed cells into\n\nshallower quiescence. That is, lys\nosomal function modulates graded\n\nquiescence depth betwe\nen proliferation and senescence as a dimmer\n\nswitch. Finally, we found that a gene-\nexpression signature developed\n\nby comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can cor-\nrectly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro\n\nand in vivo, suggesting that while qui\nescence is generally considered\n\nto protect cells from irreversible a\nrrest of senescence, quiescence\n\ndeepening likely represents a common transition path from cell pro-\nliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\nquiescence\n|\ndormancy\n|\nsenescence\n|\naging\n|\nlysosome\n\nC\nell proliferation in multicellular organisms is tightly regu-\n\nlated, and the vast majority of cells in the body stay dormant\n\nand out of the cell cycle at any given moment. The dormant\n\nstate, when reversible upon growth signals, is referred to as\n\ncellular quiescence. Quiescence protects cells against stress and\nirreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many\nphysiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and\n\ntissue repair (1\n\n–\n4). Consequently, dysregulation of cellular qui-\n\nescence can lead to a range of hyper- and hypoproliferative\ndiseases, including cancer and aging (5\n\n–\n7).\n\nIt becomes increasingly recognized that quiescence is a het-\n\nerogeneous state with graded depth. For example, following in-\njury, muscle and neural stem cells at noninjury sites in the body\nmove adaptively into shallower quiescence (alert or primed\n\nquiescent phase), positioning cells to more quickly respond to\n\ninjury and reenter the cell cycle when needed (8, 9). In other\ncases, cells move into deep quiescence and require stronger\n\ngrowth stimulation and longer times to reenter the cell cycle, as\n\nseen in hepatocytes upon partial hepatectomy in older rats than\nin younger ones (10, 11). Similarly, the quiescent state deepens\nin cells that are cultured longer under quiescence-inducing sig-\n\nnals, such as contact inhibition (12, 13) and serum starvation\n(14). Deep quiescent cells can still revert to proliferation under\n\nphysiological conditions, appearing distinct from irreversibly\n\narrested senescent cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S1\nA\n). A graded qui-\n\nescence depth indicates graded potentials for tissue repair and\n\nregeneration; yet, how quiescence depth is regulated in the cell\n\nand the connection between deep quiescence and senescence are\n\nnot well understood.\n\nIn this study, we investigate what regulates quiescence depth in\n\nrat embryonic fibroblast (REF) cells. We identified sequential\n\ntranscriptome changes as cells move progressively deeper into\n\nquiescence under longer-term serum starvation. In particular, we\n\nfound that lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass (in-\n\ndicated by the intensity of lysosomal staining and the number of\n\nlysosomes per cell) continuously increase as quiescence deepens;\n\nhowever, autophagy flux decreases. Lysosomes are hydrolytic\n\nenzyme-filled organelles in the cell that break down many types of\n\nbiomolecules\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions, fundamental for tissue repair and homeostasis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to various stressors, leading to a loss of cell proliferation, distinct from quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSCRIPTOME<|>TRANSCRIPTOME<|>The transcriptome refers to the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by the genome at any one time, reflecting gene expression levels in a specific cell type or condition.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>GENE EXPRESSION<|>Lysosomal gene expression involves the transcription of genes that encode proteins responsible for lysosomal function, which is crucial for cellular degradation and recycling processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that degrades and recycles cellular components, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAT EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS<|>CELL LINE<|>Rat embryonic fibroblasts are a type of cell line derived from rat embryos, commonly used in research to study cellular processes such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a reversible state that can transition into senescence, which is an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>Lysosomal gene expression is significantly up-regulated in deep quiescence, indicating a relationship between lysosomal function and quiescence depth.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Autophagy flux is gradually reduced as cells enter deeper quiescence, suggesting a connection between quiescence and autophagy processes.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Reducing lysosomal function drives cells deeper into quiescence and affects autophagy, indicating a relationship between these two processes.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAT EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The study measured transcriptome changes in rat embryonic fibroblasts as they transitioned from shallow to deep quiescence.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
