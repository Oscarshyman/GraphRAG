Hepatocytes in older rats are an example ofdeeper quiescent cells, displaying a longer delay before reenteringthe cell cycle and reinitiating DNA replication following partialhepatectomy, as compared to those in younger rats (Bucher,1963). Certain muscle and neural stem cells after tissue injury areexamples of shallow quiescent cells, primed to reenter the cellcycle faster upon the next damage (Rodgers et al., 2014;Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015). The dysregulation of cellular quiescencedepth can lead to disrupted tissue homeostasis, exhibiting eitheran insuf/uniFB01cient number of growing cells due to an abnormallydeep quiescence, or a depleted pool of quiescent stem andprogenitor cells due to an abnormally shallow quiescence(Orford and Scadden, 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013;Fujimaki and Yao, 2020).Although dormant and non-proliferative, quiescent cellsreside in and interact with dynamic microenvironments. Aparticular microenvironmental factor is the interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owing over tissue cells, which transports nutrients and otherdissolved molecules that in/uniFB02uence cellular activities (Jain,1987;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Freund et al., 2012;Yao et al.,2013). Interstitial/uniFB02ow also generates mechanical shear stresson cells, which affects cell morphology, migration, growth,and differentiation (Jain, 1987;Ng and Swartz, 2003;Tarbellet al., 2005;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Polacheck et al., 2011;Shirure et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2019). To date, though,cellular quiescence has been mostly studied in cell culturesunder static medium or in animal models without examiningthe effects of interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow. Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow. To obtain suf/uniFB01cient numbers of cells for/uniFB02owcytometry analyses, a micro/uniFB02uidic device was designed featuringa straight channel 420/uni03BCm in height, 4 mm in width, and 4 cm inlength. The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold. The mold with features ofmicrochannel patterns was made in an aluminum block using acomputer numerical control (CNC) machine based on a 3DComputer-Aided Design (CAD). PDMS mixture, consisting of10:1 base and curing agent, was poured onto the mold. After airbubble removal from the mixture under vacuum, the PDMS wascured at 55\n°C for 3 h. The cured PDMS substrate was then peeledoff the mold with formed microchannel grooves (Figure 1A).After punching inlet and outlet holes at the two ends of a channel,the PDMS microchannel was bonded with a glass slide followingoxygen plasma treatment of the bonding surfaces (Figure 1B).Next, a pair of inlet and outlet tubing adapters was assembled foreach device to connect the microchannel to the external/uniFB02owcontrol system. The device fabrication and packaging werecompleted with incubation at 55\n°C for an hour to enhance thebonding strength (Figure 1C). Prior to experiments, themicro/uniFB02uidic devices were sterilized by/uniFB02owing ethanol throughthe microchannels, followed by UV irradiation for 1 h inside abiosafety hood. The inner surfaces of the microchannel werecoated with 2% (w/w)/uniFB01bronectin to enhance the adhesion of cellsto the bottom surface.\nFlow Rate and\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>CELL TYPE<|>Hepatocytes are the main functional cells of the liver, involved in various metabolic processes and known to exhibit different quiescence depths based on age and physiological conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions, such as after tissue injury.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Shallow quiescence refers to a state where cells are dormant but primed to re-enter the cell cycle quickly upon stimuli, such as tissue damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Deep quiescence is a state of prolonged dormancy in cells, characterized by a longer delay before re-entering the cell cycle, often observed in older organisms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Tissue homeostasis refers to the balance and maintenance of cell populations within tissues, crucial for normal function and repair mechanisms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLUID FLOW<|>MECHANISM<|>Extracellular fluid flow is the movement of fluid outside cells that can influence cellular activities, including quiescence and tissue repair.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>RESEARCH STUDY<|>A microfluidic system designed to study cellular quiescence under controlled medium flow conditions, allowing for real-time imaging and analysis of cellular responses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATHEMATICAL MODEL<|>MECHANISM<|>A mathematical model developed to predict how extracellular fluid flow modulates quiescence depth and influences cell cycle reentry.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>Hepatocytes in older rats exhibit deep quiescence, indicating a relationship between the cell type and the biological process of quiescence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEPATOCYTES<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Hepatocytes demonstrate characteristics of quiescence, showing how this biological process affects liver cells<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Shallow quiescence is a specific manifestation of the broader biological process of quiescence, indicating a direct relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Deep quiescence is a more prolonged form of quiescence, establishing a relationship between the two states<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS<|>The dysregulation of quiescence depth can disrupt tissue homeostasis, linking the biological process to the maintenance of tissue health<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLUID FLOW<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Extracellular fluid flow influences cellular quiescence depth, indicating a relationship between the mechanism and the biological process<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The microfluidic system was used to examine the effects of fluid flow on cellular quiescence, establishing a direct relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATHEMATICAL MODEL<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The mathematical model helps predict how extracellular fluid flow modulates quiescence depth, linking the mechanism to the biological process<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
