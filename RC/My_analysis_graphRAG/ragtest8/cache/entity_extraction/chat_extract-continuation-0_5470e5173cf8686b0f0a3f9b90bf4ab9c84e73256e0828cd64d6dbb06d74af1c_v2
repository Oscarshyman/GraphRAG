Conversely,\n\nenhancing lysosomal function by ectopic Mitf expression, which\n\nreduced quiescence depth, suppressed mitochondrial ROS\n(lower MitoSox intensity) (Fig. 6\n\nE\n) in a dose-dependent manner\n\n(Fig. 6\n\nF\n). Consistently, tBHP blocked the effect of Mitf on re-\n\nducing quiescence depth: While the ectopic Mitf expression in-\ncreased the EdU\n+\n% over control, additional tBHP treatment in\nMitf-transfected cells decreased the EdU\n+\n% in a tBHP dose-\n\ndependent manner (Fig. 6\n\nG\n). We also considered that lyso-\n\nsomes may prevent quiescence deepening by increasing energy\nproduction, another known role of lysosomes (18). However,\ntreatment with metabolites known to increase ATP production,\n\nsuch as methyl pyruvate (MPy), did not reduce quiescence depth\n\nwith statistical significance (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S7\nB\n); it actually\n\nincreased quiescence depth at high concentrations (\n\nSI Appendix\n,\n\nFig. S7\n\nC\n), indicating that ATP generation is likely not respon-\n\nsible for how lysosomal function prevents quiescence deepening\nin the tested conditions, reminiscent of similar findings in yeasts\n(44). Taken together, our findings suggest that: 1) Increasing\noxidative stress deepens quiescence, and reducing oxidative\n\nstress prevents quiescence from deepening; 2) reducing lysosomal\n\nfunction increases ROS, the mediator of oxidative stress, and in-\n\ncreasing lysosomal function decreases ROS; and 3) increasing or\ndecreasing lysosomal function continuously modulates quiescence\ndepth, acting like a dimmer switch (Fig. 6\n\nH\n).\n\nQuiescence Deepening Is Linked to Cellular Senescence and Aging.\n\nFinally, we examined whether and how deep quiescence in REF\n\ncells is related to the quiescent states of other cell types (case Q)\nand other nongrowth cellular states, such as senescence (case S).\n\nTo this end, we first developed a gene-expression signature in-\n\ndicating the quiescence depth in REF cells by performing a\nlinear regression analysis of the time-course RNA-seq data (see\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nfor details). To identify a signature that\n\ncorresponds to a deepening of quiescence as opposed to simply\n\nhalting the cell cycle, we omitted the proliferating sample (0 d) from\nthe analysis and used samples corresponding to 2- to 16-d\nserum\n\nstarvation (i.e., shallow to deep quiescence) to build the regression\n\nmodel.
