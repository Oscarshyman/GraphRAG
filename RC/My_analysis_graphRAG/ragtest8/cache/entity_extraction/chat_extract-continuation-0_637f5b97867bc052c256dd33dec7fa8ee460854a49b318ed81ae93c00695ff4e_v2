The microenvironmentexperienced by cultured cells under static medium,however, is different from that experienced by tissue cellsin vivowhere they are exposed to continuous interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows. The interstitial/uniFB02ow exerts hydrodynamic shear stresson cells due to/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow viscosity and shear strain rate; the/uniFB02ow also carries fresh nutrients along with dissolvedcompounds and removes local substances secreted by cells(Jain, 1987;Wiig, 1990;Wang and Tarbell, 1995;Ng andSwartz, 2003;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Shi and Tarbell, 2011;Freund et al., 2012;Galie et al., 2012). As such, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow is known to play a critical role in repairing andremolding tissues, such as the vascular, lung, and bone(Hillsley and Frangos, 1994;Liu et al., 1999;Louis et al.,2006;Rensen et al., 2007), through affecting cell morphology,adhesion, motility, metabolism, and differentiation(Yamamoto et al., 2005;Lutolf et al., 2009;Toh andVoldman, 2011;Hyler et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019).However, whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affectscellular quiescence remains unclear.In this study, a micro/uniFB02uidic platform is designed to mimic thephysiologically relevant interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow with varying rates(Figure 1) and investigate the/uniFB02ow effects on cellular quiescence.Experimental parameters, including/uniFB02ow rate,/uniFB02uid viscosity, and/uniFB02ow volume, were varied to test the effects of/uniFB02ow rate, shear stress,and extracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth.Our results show that,/uniFB01rst, several quiescence characteristicsidenti/uniFB01ed previously under static medium are also present undercontinuous/uniFB02\nuid/uniFB02ow, including the serum signal-dependantquiescence entry and exit and the time-dependant quiescencedeepening (Figure 2). Second, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow sensitizescells to serum growth signals and thus leads to shallowquiescence. Particularly, increasing the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate reducesthe serum level needed for quiescence exit and cell cycle reentry.This result is likely due to the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow lowering theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch that controlsthe quiescence-to-proliferation transition (Yao et al., 2008;Kwonet al., 2017), as suggested by our model simulations (Figure 6). Ahigher/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate entails higher mechanical shear stress and afaster pace of extracellular factor replacement. These physical andbiochemical cues are able to drive cells into shallow quiescencewhen present either together (Figure 3) or separately (Figures 4,5). As a result, exposed to a faster extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow, cellsbecome more sensitive to serum growth signals and more likely toreenter the cell cycle.Several questions are left unanswered in our study. First, themolecular mechanisms are to be identi/uniFB01ed by which/uniFB02ow-inducedshear stress and extracellular factor replacement lower theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.Interestingly, increasing medium viscosity (by a higher dextranconcentration) promotes quiescence exit under a medium/uniFB02ow(Figure 4), but it inhibits quiescence exit in static medium(Supplementary Figure S2). This result may be associatedwith medium viscosity-induced changes in certain lipoproteinsynthesis (Yedgar et al., 1982), cytoskeleton and cell morphology(Khorshid, 2005), cell attachment and in/uniFB02ammation (\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions, influenced by various external factors such as serum and fluid flow.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLOW<|>MECHANISM<|>Extracellular flow refers to the movement of interstitial fluid that exerts shear stress on cells, affecting their behavior, morphology, and quiescence characteristics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERUM GROWTH SIGNALS<|>GROWTH FACTOR<|>Serum growth signals are factors present in serum that promote cell growth and proliferation, playing a crucial role in the transition from quiescence to active cell division.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB-E2F BISTABLE SWITCH<|>MECHANISM<|>The Rb-E2F bistable switch is a regulatory mechanism that controls the transition between quiescence and proliferation in cells, responding to various signals including extracellular flow and serum levels.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL CYCLE REENTRY<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Cell cycle reentry is the process by which quiescent cells re-enter the cell cycle to begin dividing again, often triggered by specific growth signals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM<|>RESEARCH STUDY<|>The microfluidic platform is a designed experimental setup that mimics physiological interstitial fluid flow to study its effects on cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLOW<|>Extracellular flow influences the depth of quiescence in cells, indicating a direct relationship between the biological process and the mechanism<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SERUM GROWTH SIGNALS<|>Quiescence is affected by serum growth signals, which can promote the exit from quiescence and reentry into the cell cycle<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLOW<|>RB-E2F BISTABLE SWITCH<|>Extracellular flow lowers the activation threshold of the Rb-E2F bistable switch, facilitating the transition from quiescence to proliferation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELL CYCLE REENTRY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Cell cycle reentry is a process that occurs when quiescent cells respond to growth signals, indicating a relationship between the two biological processes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The microfluidic platform is used to study the effects of fluid flow on quiescence, establishing a direct relationship between the research study and the biological process<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
