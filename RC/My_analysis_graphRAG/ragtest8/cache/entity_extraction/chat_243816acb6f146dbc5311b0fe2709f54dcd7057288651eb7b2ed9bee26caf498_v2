Two/uniFB02ow rates (Q= 5 and 20/uni03BCl/h) were used in this study; they generated average velocities of0.82 and 3.33/uni03BCm/s on the micro/uniFB02uidic platform, respectively,which are on the order of typical interstitial/uniFB02ow velocity in softtissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007). Cells were seeded inmicro/uniFB02uidic devices, and cell quiescence and proliferationstatus were assessed using a previously established and stablyintegrated E2f-GFP reporter (Yao et al., 2008), which wasvalidated by standard EdU-incorporation assay in regular cellcultures (Kwon et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2017;Fujimaki et al.,2019) as well as here on the micro/uniFB02uidic platform(Supplementary Figures S1B,C; see Methods).To induce quiescence, cells in micro/uniFB02uidic devices werecultured in serum-starvation medium (0.02% serum) for4 days under a given extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow (5 or 20/uni03BCl/h). Inthese conditions, about 95% of cells or more entered quiescence(Figures 2A,B, 0.02% serum, 4-days), as indicated by the Off-state of the E2f-GFP reporter (E2f-Off for short, the lower/leftmode of the E2f-GFP histograms inFigure 2). Quiescent cellswere subsequently stimulated to reenter the cell cycle with serumat varying concentrations (without/uniFB02ow, see Methods for details).Cells were harvested after 26 h of serum stimulation, and the E2f-GFP reporter activity was measured by/uniFB02ow cytometry. Withincreasing serum conconcentrations (0.02–4% serum, 4 days,Figure 2), higher percentages of cells exited quiescence andreentered the cell cycle, as indicated by the On-state of theE2f-GFP reporter (E2f-On for short, the higher/right mode ofthe E2f-GFP histograms inFigure 2).

One may wonder, however, whetherthis phenotype was caused by the gradual depletion of nutrientsin the static culture mediumin vitro,which may behavedifferentlyin vivounder an interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow replenishingnutrients. In the micro/uniFB02uidic platform under a constant/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow(either 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h) during serum starvation, we found cells thatremained quiescent for a longer period of time (8 days) entered adeeper quiescent state and became less likely to exit: they had asmaller E2f-On% upon a given serum stimulation than those thatremained quiescent for a shorter time (4 days,Figure 2).Together, these results showed that cellular behaviors in 1)serum signal-dependant quiescence entry and exit and 2)quiescence deepening over time are consistent regardlesswhether cells are in micro/uniFB02uidic devices exposed toextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows or in conventional static-mediumcultures.\nFast Extracellular Fluid Flow Results inShallow Quiescence\nTo examine whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow may affectcellular quiescence depth, we compared the cells induced toquiescence by serum starvation under different medium/uniFB02owrates but otherwise in the same conditions.
