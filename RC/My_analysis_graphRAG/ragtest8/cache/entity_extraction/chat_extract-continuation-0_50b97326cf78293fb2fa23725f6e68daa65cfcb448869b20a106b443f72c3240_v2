Instead, we found that autophagy\nflux, an indicator for the primary lysosomal function, did not in-\n\ncrease but gradually declined as cells moved deeper into quiescence,\n\nas seen in an LC3-II turnover assay (32) (Fig. 3\n\nA\n). This result posed\n\n2 immediate questions: 1) What is the relationship between in-\n\ncreased lysosomal mass and gene expression to decreased lysosomal\n\nfunction? 2) Does declined lysosomal function cause quiescence\ndeepening and, if so, how?\nAn increase of lysosomal mass can be caused by an increase of\nlysosome biogenesis or a decrease of lysosome destruction or\n\nboth. Since lysosome itself is destructed via an autophagic pro-\n\ncess named lysophagy (33, 34), the declined autophagy flux we\nobserved in cells with prolonged serum starvation (Fig. 3\n\nA\n)\n\nsuggests that the rate of lysosome destruction likely declines\n\naccordingly in deep quiescence. If this is the case, when we in-\nhibit autophagy/losophagy, we expect that 1) lysosomal mass will\n\nincrease in cells, and 2) the degree of increase (fold-change) will\n\nbe smaller in deep than shallow quiescent cells. Indeed, when we\ntreated 2-, 5-, and 8-d serum-starved quiescent cells with an\n\nautophagy inhibitor (nocodazole or vinblastine) (35) to repress\n\nautophagy/lysophagy (as seen by decreased autophagy flux in\nLC3 turnover assay) (Fig. 3\n\nB\n), we found that the relative in-\n\ncrease of LysoTracker intensity was smaller in cells under pro-\n\nlonged starvation (Fig. 3\n\nC\nand\nD\n). Although the result should be\n\ntaken with caveat since nocodazole and vinblastine are general\nautophagy inhibitors but not specific lysophagy inhibitors (which\n\nare lacking in the field to the best of our knowledge), and thus\n\nmay cause other side effects, this result, together with decreased\nautophagy (Fig. 3\n\nA\n), suggested that lysosome destruction de-\n\ncreased as quiescence deepened. Insufficient lysosome destruc-\n\ntion by autophagy/lysophagy can lead to an accumulation of\ndamaged lysosomes in the cell, which in turn interferes with ly-\n\nsosomal homeostasis and function (34).\n\nInterestingly, while blocking autophagy/lysophagy by either\n\nnocodazole or vinblastine increased the LysoTracker intensity in\n\nquiescent REF cells, it did not increase the number of lysosomes\n(\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4\nA\nand\nC\n) and even decreased the lysosomal\n\nnumber over time (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4\nB\nand\nD\n). This result is\n\ndifferent from the increased lysosomal number we observed,\nalong with quiescence deepening (Fig. 2\n\nH\n); it suggests that de-\n\ncreased lysosome destruction was not the only factor contribut-\n\ning to the increase of lysosomal mass in deep quiescent cells.\nIndeed, increased lysosome biogenesis (consistent with the in-\n\ncreased lysosomal gene expression, as seen in Fig. 2\n\nE\nand\nF\n) also\n\nplayed a role in this process, as we will explain further in the\n\nDiscussion\n\n. Altogether, our study suggests that increased lyso-\n\nsomal mass (containing damaged lysosomes) is both partially\n\ncaused by and contributes to decreased lysosomal function and\nautophagic clearance in deep quiescence.\n\nInhibiting L\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>REF CELLS<|>CELL LINE<|>REF cells are a type of cell line used in research to study cellular processes, particularly in the context of quiescence and lysosomal function during serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions, often influenced by nutrient availability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>GENE EXPRESSION<|>Lysosomal gene expression refers to the transcription of genes that encode proteins essential for lysosomal function, which is crucial for cellular degradation and recycling processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that degrades and recycles cellular components, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>MECHANISM<|>Lysosome destruction is a process by which damaged lysosomes are removed from the cell, often through autophagy, and is crucial for maintaining lysosomal function and cellular health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOTRACKING<|>MECHANISM<|>LysoTracking is a method used to visualize and quantify lysosomes within cells, often using fluorescent dyes to assess lysosomal mass and function.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The study investigates how REF cells enter a quiescent state during serum starvation, indicating a direct relationship between the cell line and the biological process<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>Increased lysosomal gene expression is associated with deeper quiescence, suggesting a relationship between the biological process and gene expression<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Autophagy flux declines as cells enter deeper quiescence, indicating a connection between the biological process and the cellular mechanism<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>The study suggests that increased lysosomal mass is related to decreased lysosome destruction, linking gene expression to the mechanism<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>The decline in autophagy flux suggests a relationship with lysosome destruction, as both processes are involved in lysosomal function during quiescence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>The study measures lysosomal gene expression in REF cells, establishing a direct relationship between the cell line and gene expression<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>LYSOTRACKING<|>LysoTracking is used to visualize lysosomes in REF cells, indicating a relationship between the cell line and the mechanism used to assess lysosomal function<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
