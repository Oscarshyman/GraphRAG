The Quiescence–Senescence Continuum: A Framework for Understanding\nQuiescence-Origin Senescence\n2.1. Direct Transition from Quiescence to Senescence\nMounting evidence in the past decade demonstrates a direct transition to senescence in\nquiescent cells under stress or with aging. One of the ﬁrst reports of this phenomenon was\nin geriatric mice, where quiescent satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MuSCs) lose regenerative\ncapacity and become irreversibly arrested [13]. The same observation was conﬁrmed in\ngeriatric human muscle, suggesting a conserved mechanism contributing to age-related\ndecline in muscle regenerative capacity [13]. The quiescence-to-senescence transition in\ngeriatric MuSCs was linked to the epigenetic derepression of p16INK4a, which is a key\nregulator of senescence [13].\nFurther research revealed that p16INK4aderepression in geriatric MuSCs was triggered\nby accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from failed autophagy [18]. Restor-\ning autophagy prevents the transition to senescence in quiescent MuSCs [18]. Similarly,\nin quiescent human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), stress-induced ROS\naccumulation can elevate the p16 INK4alevel and drive the transition to senescence [14].\nIn vitrostudies provide further evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence tran-\nsition. Long-term quiescent human ﬁbroblasts in culture (100–150 days) accumulate DNA\ndamage and transit into senescence [15]. Our recent work showed that quiescent rat\nembryonic ﬁbroblasts (REFs) with impaired lysosomal autophagy can directly enter a\nsenescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest,β-galactosidase activity,\nand cellular hypertrophy [16]. Thesein vitroresults strengthen the ﬁndings ofin vivo\nstudies by showing that cells maintained in quiescent conditions throughout the experi-\nments eventually transitioned to senescence, bypassing cell proliferation (which can be\ndifﬁcult to trackin vivo, e.g., throughout the entire geriatric phase). Together, thesein vivo\nandin vitrostudies provide compelling evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition, resulting in quiescence-origin senescence.\n2.2. Quiescence Deepening into Senescence: A Continuum Model\nThe observation that cells can transition from quiescence to senescence aligns with the\nconcept that quiescence is not a uniform state but rather a spectrum of dormant depths.\nSpeciﬁcally, deeper quiescent cells are more resistant to cell cycle re-entry, and they resume\nproliferation less frequently or with a longer delay than shallower quiescent cells given the\nsame growth stimulation [8,19–35]. Cells in deep quiescence generally exhibit decreased\ntranscription, reduced RNA and protein levels, and increased chromatin condensation\ncompared to cells in shallow quiescence [22,36–38]. Recent studies have further revealed the\nchanges in the cellular proﬁles of gene expression, epigenetic modiﬁcation, and metabolism\nthat occur during the process of quiescence deepening [8,16,39–41]. It is important to note\nthat deep quiescent cells, by deﬁnition, still retain the potential for cell cycle re-entry and\ncan resume proliferation given a sufﬁciently strong and sustained growth stimulus, which\nis distinct from senescent cells.\nQuiescence deepening has been observed under extended quiescence in culture or\nalong the aging processin vivoacross mammalian cell types and tissues [8,19–33] as wellBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 3 of 8\n\nas in yeast [34] and C. elegans [35]. Consistent with quiescence depth being a continuum,\nsubpopulations of quiescent muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, upon tissue\ninjury or in response to systemic factors, can move to shallower (primed or GAlert) qui-\nescence, bearing a closer resemblance to active cells [42–45]. Further extending the cell\ndormancy state continuum, senescent cells also exhibit varying “depths” with different\ncellular characteristics [46–48].\nOur recent work directly links quiescence deepening to senescence entry. We found\nthat while enhancing lysosomal autophagy activity pushes REFs toward shallow quiescence,\ndecreasing lysosomal autophagy drives REFs into progressively deeper quiescence [16].\nWhen lysosomal autophagy is severely hampered (with chloroquine treatment, for exam-\nple), deep quiescent (yet still reversible) cells transition into irreversible senescence [16].\nThis suggests that lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” that continu-\nously adjusts cellular dormancy depth from shallow quiescence to deep quiescence and\nﬁnally to senescence [16,41]. Furthermore, the transcriptomic proﬁle changes during qui-\nescence\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to stressors, leading to a loss of cell proliferation and is linked to aging and age-related diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions, often influenced by external stimuli.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE-ORIGIN SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence-origin senescence refers to the transition of quiescent cells into a senescent state, particularly under stress or aging conditions, leading to irreversible cell cycle arrest.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>CELL TYPE<|>Geriatric mice are older mice used in research to study age-related biological processes, including the transition from quiescence to senescence in muscle stem cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are specialized cells responsible for muscle regeneration, which can enter a quiescent state and transition to senescence under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>GENE EXPRESSION<|>P16INK4A is a gene that encodes a protein regulating the cell cycle, particularly involved in the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>MECHANISM<|>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules that can induce cellular stress and are implicated in the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that degrades and recycles cellular components, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the transition to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS (HSPCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) are stem cells that can differentiate into various blood cells and can transition from quiescence to senescence under stress conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAT EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS (REFs)<|>CELL LINE<|>Rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) are a cell line derived from rat embryos, commonly used in research to study cellular processes such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILE<|>TRANSCRIPTOME<|>The transcriptomic profile refers to the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by the genome at any one time, reflecting gene expression levels during cellular processes like quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence can transition into senescence under stress or aging conditions, indicating a direct relationship between the two biological processes.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>Geriatric mice are used to study the behavior of muscle stem cells, particularly their transition from quiescence to senescence, establishing a relationship between the cell type and the biological process.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>P16INK4A<|>The transition of muscle stem cells to senescence is linked to the epigenetic derepression of P16INK4A, indicating a relationship between the cell type and gene expression.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>P16INK4A<|>Accumulated ROS can trigger the derepression of P16INK4A in muscle stem cells, linking the mechanism to gene expression involved in the transition to senescence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>SENESCENCE<|>Impaired autophagy can lead to the transition of quiescent cells into senescence, indicating a relationship between the cellular mechanism and the biological process.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS (HSPCs)<|>SENESCENCE<|>HSPCs can transition to senescence due to stress-induced ROS accumulation, establishing a relationship between the cell type and the biological process.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAT EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS (REFs)<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The study shows that quiescent rat embryonic fibroblasts can transition to a senescence-like state, indicating a direct relationship between the cell line and the biological process.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Changes in the transcriptomic profile occur during the process of quiescence deepening, linking gene expression to the biological process of quiescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
