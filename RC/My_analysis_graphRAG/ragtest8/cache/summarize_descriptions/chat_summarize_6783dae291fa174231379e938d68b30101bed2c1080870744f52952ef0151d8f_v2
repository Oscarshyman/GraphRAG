Shear stress, generated by extracellular fluid flow, affects the depth of quiescence, indicating a direct and strong relationship between this physical mechanism and the biological process of quiescence. Specifically, shear stress not only influences the quiescent state of cells but also promotes the exit from quiescence, further underscoring the interconnectedness of mechanical forces and cellular behavior. This body of evidence suggests that shear stress plays a critical role in modulating the quiescent state, highlighting its importance in understanding cellular responses to mechanical stimuli.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743983080, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 394, "total_tokens": 527, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
