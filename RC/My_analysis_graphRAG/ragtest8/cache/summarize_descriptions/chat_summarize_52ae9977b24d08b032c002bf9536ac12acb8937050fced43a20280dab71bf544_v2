It is utilized as a medium component to manipulate viscosity and shear stress, which in turn influences cellular responses and behaviors. Specifically, dextran has been shown to affect cellular processes such as the induction of quiescence in cells, especially when incorporated into serum-starvation media. By modifying the viscosity of the culture medium, dextran helps researchers study the effects of these changes on cellular behavior, including the modulation of quiescence depth during serum starvation. Overall, dextran serves as a valuable tool in the investigation of cellular dynamics and responses in biological research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743983074, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 525, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
