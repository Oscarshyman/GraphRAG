They play a crucial role in the regulation of both quiescence and proliferation, which are essential processes for maintaining the balance of neural cell populations. During aging, NSCs exhibit a phenomenon known as quiescence deepening, which can be influenced by lysosomal defects and the accumulation of protein aggregates.
