These cells are particularly focused on studying quiescence, cell cycle reentry, and proliferation under diverse experimental conditions, including serum-starvation and serum stimulation. Additionally, REF/E23 cells are employed in microfluidic environments to explore cellular responses to different stimuli, such as extracellular fluid flow. Notably, this cell line features a stably integrated E2f1 promoter-driven destabilized GFP reporter, which aids in the analysis of gene expression related to quiescence and other cellular dynamics. Overall, REF/E23 cells serve as a valuable tool for researchers aiming to understand the intricate mechanisms governing cellular behavior in response to environmental changes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743983074, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 431, "total_tokens": 593, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
