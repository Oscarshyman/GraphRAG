It is utilized to modulate this quiescence, indicating a direct relationship between dextran, a growth factor, and the biological process of quiescence. Furthermore, dextran has been shown to promote the exit from quiescence under specific conditions, further underscoring its impact on cellular behavior. The concentration of dextran in serum-starvation medium is critical, as it affects the depth of quiescence, thereby establishing a clear connection between dextran and the regulation of quiescence in cellular environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743983080, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
