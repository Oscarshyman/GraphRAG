Quiescence is characterized as a reversible state of dormancy, where cells temporarily halt their proliferation. Under conditions of stress or aging, quiescent cells can transition into senescence, which is an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest. This transition highlights the connection between the two processes, as quiescence can lead to senescence when cells are subjected to adverse conditions. While both states involve a cessation of cell division, they differ fundamentally in their reversibility and the mechanisms that govern them.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743983078, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
