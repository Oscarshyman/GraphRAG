It highlights the significance of these processes in the context of aging and regenerative medicine, providing insights into how extracellular flow influences quiescence depth and the underlying mechanisms involved. Notably, the publication discusses findings from Liu et al., which reveal that extracellular flow can induce shallow quiescence in cells. Additionally, it presents a graded regulation of cellular quiescence depth and its transition to senescence, integrating various studies that examine the interplay between quiescence, senescence, and growth factors across different cell types. The publication is titled \"Quiescence-Origin Senescence: A New Paradigm in Cellular Aging,\" proposing a novel framework for understanding the intricate relationship between quiescence and senescence. This study on extracellular flow and quiescence was published in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, contributing valuable knowledge to the field of cellular biology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743983071, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 474, "total_tokens": 674, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
