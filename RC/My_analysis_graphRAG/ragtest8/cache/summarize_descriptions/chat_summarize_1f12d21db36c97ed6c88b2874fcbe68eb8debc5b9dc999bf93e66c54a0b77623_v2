This process is particularly focused on several key aspects, including the assessment of cell cycle entry, quiescence, and the ability of cells to re-enter the cell cycle after a period of quiescence. The responses measured during serum stimulation include E2F-On% levels, cell proliferation, and the dynamics of quiescence exit. Overall, serum stimulation serves as a critical experimental approach to understand how cells transition between quiescent states and active proliferation, providing insights into cellular behavior in response to serum factors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743983072, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 622, "total_tokens": 752, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
