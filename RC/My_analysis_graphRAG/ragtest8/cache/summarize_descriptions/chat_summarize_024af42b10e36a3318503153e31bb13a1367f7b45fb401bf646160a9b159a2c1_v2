These cells play a crucial role in muscle regeneration and repair, facilitating the recovery of muscle tissue following injury or stress. Muscle stem cells exhibit a dynamic behavior, often transitioning between quiescence (a state of inactivity) and activation, which allows them to respond effectively to the physiological demands of muscle maintenance and repair.
