-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [cell line, biological process, gene expression, research study, scientific publication, cell type, mechanism, autophagy, quiescence, senescence, transcriptome, growth factor]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

text:
cence is, however, not a uniform state but with graded
depth. Shallow quiescent cells exhibit a higher tendency to revert to
proliferation than deep quiescent cells, while deep quiescent cells

are still fully reversible under physiological conditions, distinct from

senescent cells. Cellular mechani
sms underlying the control of quies-

cence depth and the connection between quiescence and senescence

are poorly characterized, representing a missing link in our under-

standing of tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Here we measured
transcriptome changes as rat embryonic fibroblasts moved from
shallow to deep quiescence over time in the absence of growth

signals. We found that lysosomal gene expression was significantly

up-regulated in deep quiescence, an
d partially compensated for grad-

ually reduced autophagy flux. Reduc
ing lysosomal function drove

cells progressively deeper into qui
escence and eventually into a

senescence-like irreversibly arrested state; increasing lysosomal func-

tion, by lowering oxidative stress
, progressively pushed cells into

shallower quiescence. That is, lys
osomal function modulates graded

quiescence depth betwe
en proliferation
