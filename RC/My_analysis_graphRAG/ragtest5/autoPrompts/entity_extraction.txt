-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [cell, phenotype, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, growth factor, tissue homeostasis, stem cell, DNA damage, oxidative stress, microfluidic system]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

text:
 has been a focal point
of biomedical research for decades [1]. It is typically triggered when growing cells are
overwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene
activation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].
Cells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences
like malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells
include permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),
macromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and
other morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding
of senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.
In contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-
logical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells
exit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low
metabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes
associated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of
growth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact
inhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-
cent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain
cellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role
in tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to
safeguard cells from senescence [11,12].
Recent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional
paradigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in

 quiescence has been mostly studied in cell culturesunder static medium or in animal models without examiningthe effects of interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow. Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02
ow rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication
A micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow. To obtain suf/uniFB01cient numbers of cells for/uniFB02owcytometry analyses, a micro/uniFB02uidic device was designed featuringa straight channel 420/uni03BCm in height, 4 mm in width, and 4 cm inlength. The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold.
