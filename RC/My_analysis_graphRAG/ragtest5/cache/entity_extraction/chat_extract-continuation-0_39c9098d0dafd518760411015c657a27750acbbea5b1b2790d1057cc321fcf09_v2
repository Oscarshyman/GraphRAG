It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold.
