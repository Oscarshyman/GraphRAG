It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold.

Instead, we found that autophagy\nflux, an indicator for the primary lysosomal function, did not in-\n\ncrease but gradually declined as cells moved deeper into quiescence,\n\nas seen in an LC3-II turnover assay (32) (Fig. 3\n\nA\n). This result posed\n\n2 immediate questions: 1) What is the relationship between in-\n\ncreased lysosomal mass and gene expression to decreased lysosomal\n\nfunction? 2) Does declined lysosomal function cause quiescence\ndeepening and, if so, how?\nAn increase of lysosomal mass can be caused by an increase of\nlysosome biogenesis or a decrease of lysosome destruction or\n\nboth. Since lysosome itself is destructed via an autophagic pro-\n\ncess named lysophagy (33, 34), the declined autophagy flux we\nobserved in cells with prolonged serum starvation (Fig. 3\n\nA\n)\n\nsuggests that the rate of lysosome destruction likely declines\n\naccordingly in deep quiescence. If this is the case, when we in-\nhibit autophagy/losophagy, we expect that 1) lysosomal mass will\n\nincrease in cells, and 2) the degree of increase (fold-change) will\n\nbe smaller in deep than shallow quiescent cells. Indeed, when we\ntreated 2-, 5-, and 8-d serum-starved quiescent cells with an\n\nautophagy inhibitor (nocodazole or vinblastine) (35) to repress\n\nautophagy/lysophagy (as seen by decreased autophagy flux in\nLC3 turnover assay) (Fig. 3\n\nB\n), we found that the relative in-\n\ncrease of LysoTracker intensity was smaller in cells under pro-\n\nlonged starvation (Fig. 3\n\nC\nand\nD\n). Although the result should be\n\ntaken with caveat since nocodazole and vinblastine are general\nautophagy inhibitors but not specific lysophagy inhibitors (which\n\nare lacking in the field to the best of our knowledge), and thus\n\nmay cause other side effects, this result, together with decreased\nautophagy (Fig. 3\n\nA\n), suggested that lysosome destruction de-\n\ncreased as quiescence deepened. Insufficient lysosome destruc-\n\ntion by autophagy/lysophagy can lead to an accumulation of\ndamaged lysosomes in the cell, which in turn interferes with ly-\n\nsosomal homeostasis and function (34).\n\nInterestingly, while blocking autophagy/lysophagy by either\n\nnocodazole or vinblastine increased the LysoTracker intensity in\n\nquiescent REF cells, it did not increase the number of lysosomes\n(\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4\nA\nand\nC\n) and even decreased the lysosomal\n\nnumber over time (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4\nB\nand\nD\n). This result is\n\ndifferent from the increased lysosomal number we observed,\nalong with quiescence deepening (Fig. 2\n\nH\n); it suggests that de-\n\ncreased lysosome destruction was not the only factor contribut-\n\ning to the increase of lysosomal mass in deep quiescent cells.\nIndeed, increased lysosome biogenesis (consistent with the in-\n\ncreased lysosomal gene expression, as seen in Fig. 2\n\nE\nand\nF\n) also\n\nplayed a role in this process, as we will explain further in the\n\nDiscussion\n\n. Altogether, our study suggests that increased lyso-\n\nsomal mass (containing damaged lysosomes) is both partially\n\ncaused by and contributes to decreased lysosomal function and\nautophagic clearance in deep quiescence.\n\nInhibiting L\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal function refers to the processes carried out by lysosomes, including the degradation and recycling of cellular components, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>MECHANISM<|>Lysosome destruction is a process that involves the breakdown of lysosomes, which can occur through autophagy, specifically a process known as lysophagy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of cellular inactivity where cells do not proliferate, often influenced by external factors such as serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>MECHANISM<|>Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that involves the degradation of damaged organelles and proteins, playing a critical role in cellular maintenance and response to stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSO-TRACKER INTENSITY<|>PHENOTYPE<|>LysoTracker intensity is a measure of lysosomal activity and number within cells, used to assess lysosomal function and autophagic processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>MECHANISM<|>Serum starvation is a condition where cells are deprived of serum, leading to various cellular responses, including quiescence and changes in lysosomal function.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>As quiescence deepens, lysosomal function declines, indicating a relationship between the state of quiescence and the efficiency of lysosomal processes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>Decreased lysosome destruction is associated with deeper quiescence, suggesting that quiescent cells accumulate damaged lysosomes over time<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>Autophagy is responsible for lysosome destruction, and a decline in autophagic activity leads to reduced lysosome turnover in quiescent cells<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSO-TRACKER INTENSITY<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>LysoTracker intensity is used to evaluate lysosomal function, indicating a direct relationship between lysosomal activity and the measurement of lysosomal mass<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Serum starvation induces quiescence in cells, demonstrating a clear link between nutrient availability and cellular proliferation states<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The decline in autophagy during prolonged quiescence suggests that autophagic processes are crucial for maintaining cellular health in non-dividing states<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
