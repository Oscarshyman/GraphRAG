It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

The present study shows\n\nthat instead of a simple OFF\n\n–\nON switch, lysosomes function as a\n\ndimmer switch to continuously modulate quiescence depth (Fig.\n\n6\n\nH\n) and proliferative capacity of quiescent cells.\n\nOur study suggests that as cells move deeper in quiescence,\nlysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass increase, but ly-\n\nsosomal function and lysosome destruction decrease. Decreased\n\nlysosome destruction via autophagy/lysophagy contributes to an\nincreased lysosomal mass and likely an accumulation of damaged\nlysosomes, which in turn contributes to a decreased lysosomal\n\n–\n\n\nautophagy function. Decreased lysosome destruction alone,\n\nhowever, does not fully explain the increased lysosomal mass\n(both lysoTracker intensity of lysosome number) observed in\n\ndeep quiescent cells (Fig. 2\n\nG\nand\nH\n), as blocking lysosome\n\ndestruction increased LysoTracker intensity but not the number\nof lysosomes in REF cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4); similarly, it was\n\nreported previously that lysosomal number did not change or\n\neven mildly decreased in autophagy-impaired fibroblasts with\n\nAtg4B and Atg7 mutations (46). The other contributing factor of\nincreased lysosomal mass in deep quiescence appears to be ly-\nsosomal biogenesis: The expression of Mitf, a master regulator of\n\nlysosomal biogenesis, significantly increased the lysosomal\n\nnumber (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S6\nE\n) in quiescent REF cells. Con-\n\nsistently, we found that applying small chemical inhibitors to\nrepress Mcoln1 (also known as TRPML1) that is crucial for ly-\n\nsosome biogenesis (47) significantly decreased lysosomal number\n\nin quiescent REF cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S8\nA\nand\nB\n). The in-\n\ncrease in lysosome biogenesis itself is likely compensatory to\n\nquiescence deepening: Mitf expression increases significantly\n\nalong with quiescence deepening (Fig. 5\n\nA\n); relatedly, inhibiting\n\nlysosome biogenesis further deepens quiescence (lower EdU\n+\n%\nwith Mcoln1 inhibitors than with DMSO control) (\n\nSI Appendix\n,\n\nFig. S8\n\nC\n). The dynamic balance and relative contributions of\n\nlysosome biogenesis and degradation destruction in deep quies-\ncence await further investigation.\nREF cells in deep quiescence exhibited reduced autophagy\n\nflux (Fig. 3\n\nA\n), which may be relevant to the declined autophagy\n\nobserved in aging (15, 48\n\n–\n50) and senescent cells (17, 51).
