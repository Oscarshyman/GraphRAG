It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

It is\n\nunclear what resulted in declined autophagy in deep quiescence\ndespite increased lysosomal gene expression (Fig. 2\n\nE\n) and bio-\n\ngenesis. Note that not every lysosomal gene increased expression\n\nwith quiescence deepening: A small subset of lysosomal genes\nenriched for those that also function in the Golgi network\nshowed a general decrease (see cluster B in Fig. 2\n\nE\nfor enrich-\n\nment analysis and\n\nSI Appendix\n, Table S2). As the Golgi network\n\nis critical to transporting lysosomal hydrolases from cytoplasmic\nribosomes into lysosomal vesicles (52), the reduced expression of\n\nsome of these related genes, therefore, may lead to a reduced\n\nlysosomal\n\n–\nautophagy function. Alternatively, the\n“\nnet\n”\ndecrease\n\nin lysosomal function may be adaptive and serve as a cellular\ncounter for serum-deprivation duration (i.e., environmental\n\ngrowth restriction), which in turn determines how cautious the\n\ncell will get before resuming growth. The exact mechanisms\ndictating the relationship between lysosomal function and qui-\nescence depth awaits further studies.\n\nOur results suggest that lysosomal function prevents quies-\n\ncence deepening via ROS reduction (Fig. 6). Previous studies\nhave shown that the lysosome\n\n–\nautophagy pathway reduces ROS\n\nin several types of quiescent cells (15, 16) through mitophagy:\n\nThat is, selective autophagic degradation of damaged mito-\n\nchondria (15). It remains to be tested whether lysosomes prevent\nquiescence deepening in REF cells via mitophagy, but the re-\n\nduced mitochondrial ROS levels resulting from enhanced lyso-\n\nsomal function (Fig. 6\n\nE\nand\nF\n) is consistent with this model.\n\nIt was shown previously that mTORC1 can transform muscle\nstem cells into a shallower quiescent state, called GAlert, in which\n\ncells are sensitized to growth stimulation (8). Consistently, con-\n\ntinuous mTORC1 activation led to depletion of certain types of\nquiescent stem cells in vivo by forcing cell cycle reentry (53, 54).\n\nIt is well established that mTORC1 drives cell growth and in-\n\nhibits the lysosome-autophagy pathway (43, 55). Accordingly, the\n\neffect of mTORC1 on quiescence depth is likely 2-sided: By\npromoting cell growth, mTORC1 facilitates quiescence exit and\nthus reduces quiescence depth; by inhibiting lysosomal function,\n\nmTORC1 drives cells deeper into quiescence. In the GAlertcase,\n\nwhere mTORC1 is activated both before and during stimulation,\nthe net result appears to be shallower quiescence. The exact\nbimodal effects of mTORC1 on quiescence depth may be com-\n\nplicated and condition-dependent, awaiting future studies.\n\nThe lysosome\n\n–\nautophagy pathway plays an important role in\n\ncancer physiology and dormancy (5, 40, 41, 56\n\n–\n58). Activities of\n\nMiT/TFE family members, including Tfeb and Mitf, are up-regulated\n\nby overexpression or nuclear localization in multiple cancer types,\nincluding lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers (41, 59, 60), which is\nlinked to poor prognosis and survival (59, 60). The lysosome\n\n–\nauto-\n\nphagy pathway appears to help mai\nntain dormant cancer cells and\n\nfacilitate survival and metastasis (5). Consistently, autophagy in-\nhibition decreases the viability of dormant breast cancer cells and\ntheir metastatic recurrence, suggesting a promising treatment\n\nstrategy (57). Future studies are needed to determine the op-\n\ntimal target and degree of lysosomal\n\n–\nautophagy inhibition in treat-\n\nment to minimize disrupting the qu\niescence depth of normal cells.\n\nOur study highlights that deep quiescent cells exhibit gene-\n\nexpression signatures that are similar to senescent and aged cells\n\n(Fig. 7\n\nB\n–\nE\n). The enriched up-regulation of lysosomal genes\n\n(KEGG_lysosome gene set) is shown in 10 of the 11 studied\n\naging tissues (adrenal gland, br\nain, heart, kidney, liver, lung,\n\nspleen, thymus, uterus, testis,\nbut not muscle); it is also shown\n\nin 5 of the 6 cell lines (BJ, IMR-90, WI-38, HFF, MRC-5, but\nnot MDAH041) studied under replicative senescence, but not\n\nshown in stress (Adriamycin/5-aza/H2O2)-induced senescence in\n\nMDAH041 cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Table S4). This result is consistent\n\nwith the findings that senescence and aging are partially driven\nby ROS and can be counteracted by lysosome\n\n–\nautophagy activ-\n\nities in many but not all conditions (6, 15, 17, 61\n\n–\n63), indicating\n\nthe contributions of other potentially shared mechanisms un-\nderlying deep quiescence, senescence, and aging.
