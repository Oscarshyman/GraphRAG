It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

We have\nshown that the Rb–E2F switch threshold can be modulated by multiple factors in the\nRb–E2F pathway with varying degrees of sensitivity with those associated with G1 cyclins\nand cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) being the most prominent [28].\nThe Rb–E2F switch is the ﬁrst bistable switch that cells encounter during the transition\nfrom quiescence to proliferation in response to mitogens, and it connects to downstream\nbistable switches and checkpoints regulating S phase entry [67,68]. Given that the Rb–E2F\npathway interacts with other quiescence regulatory pathways (e.g., Notch–Hes1, p53–p21,\nPI3K–Akt, DNA damage response, LKB1–AMPK, and microRNA) [10,27,63], we propose\nthat the Rb–E2F switch serves as a core hub that integrates cellular signals to quantitatively\ndetermine the growth stimulation level required for the all-or-none cell cycle re-entry. In\nparallel, other cellular pathways impinge on the Rb–E2F switch and modulate its switch\nthreshold. This modulatory effect may occur through crosstalk with various gene nodes in\nthe Rb–E2F switch network, most effectively by affecting G1 cyclin and CDK activities in\nthe cell [13,28,69]. Higher thresholds lead to deeper quiescence and, eventually, senescence\nwhen physiological growth signals can no longer overcome the threshold [27,41]. Therefore,\nthe difference between deep quiescence and senescence lies primarily in the magnitude of\nthe Rb–E2F switch threshold rather than in fundamentally distinct cellular characteristics,\naligning with the quiescence–senescence continuum model.\nThe lysosomal–autophagy axis discussed above driving quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition in MuSCs directly increases the Rb–E2F switch threshold (by activating p16 that\ninhibits CDK activity) [13,18]. Similarly, increasing the Rb–E2F switch threshold has been\nreported to drive deep quiescence in MuSCs via fasting-induced ketone body signaling (by\nincreasing p21 that inhibits CDK) [69]. This threshold mechanism predicts a potential way\nto reverse the “irreversible” senescence by reducing the Rb–E2F switch threshold. Indeed,\nstudies have shown that senescent cells can be reactivated as such, e.g., by inactivating Rb,\np53–p21, or p16 activities [70–75] or by the forced G1 cyclin upregulation [76].\n3.3. Remaining Unknowns and the Heterogeneity in Quiescence-Origin Senescence\nSeveral key areas remain to be explored. The role of mTOR signaling, for instance,\npresents an intriguing paradox. mTOR is a major driver of proliferation-origin senescence,\nunderlying the process of geroconversion—a process in which mTOR-driven cell growth\ncontinues aberrantly after the cell cycle is blocked (e.g., by CDK inhibitors p21CIP1/Waf1 and\np16INK4a) [11,77]. In quiescence, mTOR is inactive and cells lack sustained growth, which\nhas been proposed as a mechanism to protect quiescent cells against senescence [11,77]. This\nquestions the involvement of mTOR in quiescence deepening and the quiescence-origin\nsenescence, which aligns with the fact that mTOR activity is linked to shallow quiescence\n(GAlert) [42], not quiescence deepening. Therefore, the quiescence-origin senescence appears\ndifferent from proliferation-origin senescence from the aspect of mTOR and geroconversion\n(Figure 1).Biomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 5 of 8\n\n\nFigure 1.Quiescence-origin senescence. Conventional senescence originates from proliferating and\ngrowing cells via mTOR-mediated geroconversion, when cell growth continues aberrantly after the\ncell cycle is blocked in response to severe stress and damage. In comparison, quiescence-origin\nsenescence originates from quiescent cells via quiescence deepening, accompanied by a progressively\nincreasing Rb–E2F switch threshold in response to decreased lysosomal autophagy and increased ROS\naccumulation and protein aggregation. Senescent cells are irreversibly arrested under physiological\nconditions. Deep quiescent cells are reversible but require stronger growth stimulation and take a\nlonger time to re-enter the cell cycle than shallow quiescent cells. The boundary between very deep\nquiescence and quiescence-origin senescence (the red dashed line) is blurred.\nEpigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in proliferation-origin senescence, including\nthe formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) that repress E2F target\ngenes [78] and changes in DNA methylation and histone modiﬁcationpatterns [79,80].\nEpigenetic mechanisms are also involved in quiescence deepening and transition to senes-\ncence, as seen in the ROS-mediated derepression of the p16 locus [18] and the role of ketone\nbody-mediated acetylation and activation of the p53 locus [69] in MuSCs as\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
