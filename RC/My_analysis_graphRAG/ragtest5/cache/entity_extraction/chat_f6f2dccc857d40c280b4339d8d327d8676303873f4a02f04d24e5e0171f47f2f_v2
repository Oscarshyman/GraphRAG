It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60% EdU\n+\nrate) (Fig. 1\nA\nand\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S1\n C\n),\n\nand the serum concentration req\nuired for cell cycle reentry in-\n\ncreased from\n\n<\n2% to\n∼\n8% (to achieve\n∼\n60% EdU\n+\nmeasured at\n\nthe 25th hour of serum stimulation) (Fig. 1\n\nB\n). This result is con-\n\nsistent with our earlier findings that the time and serum threshold\nrequired for cell cycle reentry are 2\nrelated features that both reflect\n\nthe same biological state, the quiescence depth (14). Importantly,\n\ndeep quiescent cells were not irre\nversibly arrested. For example,\n\nupon 20% serum stimulation, 92.\n6% of 16-d serum-starved deep\n\nquiescent REF cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU\n+\n)\n\nwithin 41 h (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S1\n B\n).\n\nTo identify molecular mechanisms regulating quiescence\ndepth at the transcriptional level, we performed RNA-sequencing\n\n(RNA-seq) analysis of 0- to 16-d serum-starved cells (26). As\n\nexpected, the expression of well-characterized proliferation\ngenes\n\n—\nsuch as E2f1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 (\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n A\n)\n—\n\n\nE2f1 target genes (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n B\n), and proliferation-\n\nrelated gene clusters (#7 and 9,\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n C\n)was\n\nquickly down-regulated within 2-d serum starvation. Conversely,\nthe expression of growth inhibitory genes, such as Rb1, Cdkn1a\n(p21Cip1), and Cdkn1b (p27Kip1), was up-regulated upon se-\n\nrum starvation (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n A\n). The expression of Cdkn2a\n\n(p16INK4A), a senescence marker (27), remained low as cells\nmoved deeper in quiescence (3- to 16-d serum starvation) (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S2\n D\n), consistent with quiescence being a\n\nreversible state.\n\nThe global gene-expression profile changed drastically when\ncells transitioned from proliferation to quiescence (0- to 2-d\n\nserum starvation) and continued to change sequentially as cells\n\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (2- to 16-d serum star-\nvation) (Fig. 1\n\nC\n). This sequential change was reflected in 9 gene\n\nclusters that exhibited different temporal dynamic patterns (Fig.\n\n2\n\nA\nand\nB\n). In particular, the expression of 2 gene clusters\n\nappeared to be positively correlated with quiescence deepening\nand increased monotonically as cells moved from shallow to\n\ndeep quiescence (clusters 1 and 3) (Fig. 2\n\nB\n). In cluster 1, mul-\n\ntiple biological functions were enriched; among them, lysosome\n\nwas overall the most statistically significant in Kyoto Encyclo-\n\npedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) overrepresentation tests\n\n[Fig. 2\n\nC\n, using clusterProfiler (28);\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n, using\n\nDAVID (29)]. In cluster 3, lysosome was the single function\n\nsignificantly enriched statistically (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n). Con-\n\nsistently, lysosomal genes also had the strongest positive corre-\n\nlation with deep quiescence in gene set enrichment analysis\n\n(GSEA) (30) (normalized enrichment score [NES]\n\n=\n3.12)\n\n(Fig. 2\n\nD\n).\n\nLysosomal Gene Expression and Lysosomal Mass Increase as Quiescence\n\nDeepens.\nThe vast majority of lysosomal genes, encoding for various\n\nlysosomal enzymes, activator proteins, membrane proteins, and ion\n\nchannel proteins, increased their expression continuously as cells\n\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (Fig. 2\n\nE\n[cluster C and the\n\nbottom half of cluster A], Fig. 2\n\nF\n,and\n SI Appendix\n,Fig.S3\n A\n). As a\n\ncomparison, the expression of most genes associated with endo-\n\nsomes, another cellular organelle in the endosomal\n\n–\nlysosomal sys-\n\ntem, only increased significantly during the first 2 d of serum\n\nstarvation but not afterward as quiescence continued to deepen\n(Fig. 2\n\nF\nand\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S3\n B\nand\nC\n).\n\nLysosomal mass also increased in deep quiescence: Following\n\na brief pulsatile adaptive response (within the first 6 h) upon\n\nserum starvation, lysosomal mass continuously increased over\n\nthe next 14 d, as seen from the stained LysoTracker intensity\n\n(Fig. 2\n\nG\n).
