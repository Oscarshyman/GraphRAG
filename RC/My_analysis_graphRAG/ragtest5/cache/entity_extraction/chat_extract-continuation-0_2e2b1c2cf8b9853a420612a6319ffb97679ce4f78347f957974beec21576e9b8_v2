It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold.

However, these cells were reversible and\n\nbecame EdU\n+\nby the 48th hour (Fig. 4\n\nG\n). In comparison, a\n\nprolonged lysosomal inhibition by CQ treatment at a lower dose\n(54 h, 5\n\n/uni03BC\nM) drove a significant subpopulation of quiescent cells\n\ninto a more irreversible state: As seen in Fig. 4\n\nH\n, 41.4\n±\n2.9%\n\nsuch treated cells remained EdU\n−\nafter 48 h of 20% serum\n\nstimulation; in comparison,\n\n<\n2.5% of nontreated control cells\n\nremained EdU\n−\n(Fig. 4\n\nH\n). This result in quiescent cells may be\n\nrelated to earlier findings that a repeated or long exposure to\n\nsublethal stresses can effectively induce proliferating cells to\nsenescence (37, 38). In addition to the irreversible phenotype, we\nfound that long-term CQ exposed qu\niescent cells exhibited other\n\nhallmarks of senescence: A significantly increased\n\nβ\n-galactosidase\n\nactivity (\n\nP\n=\n0.011 in 1-tailed\nt\ntest) (Fig. 4\nI\n) and hypertrophy with a\n\nsignificantly increased cell size upon serum stimulation (\n\nP\n=\n0.003 in\n\n1-tailed\n\nt\ntest) (Fig. 4\nJ\n). Taken together, our data suggest that an\n\nimpairment of lysosomal function in quiescent cells can lead to deep\n\nquiescence and potentially a senescence-like state.\n\nEnhancing Lysosomal Function Pushes Cells toward Shallower Quiescence.\n\nIf the impaired lysosomal function is responsible for quiescence\n\ndeepening, enhancing such function will likely counteract this trend\n\nand push cells into shallower quiescence. Consistent with this hy-\n\npothesis, we observed that nutrient starvation, a known inducer of\nautophagy, pushed cells into shallo\nwer quiescence: Serum-starved\n\nREF cells treated with PBS (i.e., unde\nr additional nutrient starvation)\n\nfor 320 min showed significantly higher E2f-ON% (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.\n\nS6\n\nA\n)andEdU\n +\n%(\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S6\n B\n) upon serum stimulation\n\nthan treated with control (i.e., wit\nhout nutrient starvation). This re-\n\nsult is similar to what was previous\nly observed in quiescent neural\n\nstem cells (NSCs) (39). However, nut\nrient starvation induces a range\n\nof cellular responses (e.g., AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition)\nin addition to autophagy. To increa\nse lysosomal function directly, we\n\nsought to enhance lysosomal gene\nexpression and biogenesis in REF\n\ncells. Lysosomal gene expression and biogenesis can be up-regulated\n\nby a MiT/TFE family of transcript\nion factors Tfeb, Mitf, and Tfe3,\n\nwhich bind to a CLEAR-box sequence upstream of many lysosomal\ngenes and are known as the master re\ngulator of lysosome biogenesis\nA\n\nC\n BEF\n\nG\nD\n\nI\nH\n\nJ\n\nFig. 4.\n\nLysosomal inhibition pushes cells into deeper quiescence and senescent-like state.
