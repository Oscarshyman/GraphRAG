It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

The microdevices, made of optically transparentpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184,Dow CorningCorporation, 3097358-1004), also allow real-time imaging ofcells during experimentation.The device fabrication process, illustrated inFigure 1, startedwith the fabrication of a master mold.

The microenvironmentexperienced by cultured cells under static medium,however, is different from that experienced by tissue cellsin vivowhere they are exposed to continuous interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows. The interstitial/uniFB02ow exerts hydrodynamic shear stresson cells due to/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow viscosity and shear strain rate; the/uniFB02ow also carries fresh nutrients along with dissolvedcompounds and removes local substances secreted by cells(Jain, 1987;Wiig, 1990;Wang and Tarbell, 1995;Ng andSwartz, 2003;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Shi and Tarbell, 2011;Freund et al., 2012;Galie et al., 2012). As such, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow is known to play a critical role in repairing andremolding tissues, such as the vascular, lung, and bone(Hillsley and Frangos, 1994;Liu et al., 1999;Louis et al.,2006;Rensen et al., 2007), through affecting cell morphology,adhesion, motility, metabolism, and differentiation(Yamamoto et al., 2005;Lutolf et al., 2009;Toh andVoldman, 2011;Hyler et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019).However, whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affectscellular quiescence remains unclear.In this study, a micro/uniFB02uidic platform is designed to mimic thephysiologically relevant interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow with varying rates(Figure 1) and investigate the/uniFB02ow effects on cellular quiescence.Experimental parameters, including/uniFB02ow rate,/uniFB02uid viscosity, and/uniFB02ow volume, were varied to test the effects of/uniFB02ow rate, shear stress,and extracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth.Our results show that,/uniFB01rst, several quiescence characteristicsidenti/uniFB01ed previously under static medium are also present undercontinuous/uniFB02\nuid/uniFB02ow, including the serum signal-dependantquiescence entry and exit and the time-dependant quiescencedeepening (Figure 2). Second, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow sensitizescells to serum growth signals and thus leads to shallowquiescence. Particularly, increasing the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate reducesthe serum level needed for quiescence exit and cell cycle reentry.This result is likely due to the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow lowering theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch that controlsthe quiescence-to-proliferation transition (Yao et al., 2008;Kwonet al., 2017), as suggested by our model simulations (Figure 6). Ahigher/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate entails higher mechanical shear stress and afaster pace of extracellular factor replacement. These physical andbiochemical cues are able to drive cells into shallow quiescencewhen present either together (Figure 3) or separately (Figures 4,5). As a result, exposed to a faster extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow, cellsbecome more sensitive to serum growth signals and more likely toreenter the cell cycle.Several questions are left unanswered in our study. First, themolecular mechanisms are to be identi/uniFB01ed by which/uniFB02ow-inducedshear stress and extracellular factor replacement lower theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.Interestingly, increasing medium viscosity (by a higher dextranconcentration) promotes quiescence exit under a medium/uniFB02ow(Figure 4), but it inhibits quiescence exit in static medium(Supplementary Figure S2). This result may be associatedwith medium viscosity-induced changes in certain lipoproteinsynthesis (Yedgar et al., 1982), cytoskeleton and cell morphology(Khorshid, 2005), cell attachment and in/uniFB02ammation (\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a reversible state in which cells are inactive and do not proliferate, influenced by various external factors such as fluid flow and serum signals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>A microfluidic system is a device designed to manipulate small volumes of fluids, allowing for controlled experiments to study cellular behaviors under specific conditions, such as quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of living organisms, which can enter a quiescent state under certain conditions, affecting their growth and division.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERUM<|>GROWTH FACTOR<|>Serum is a component that contains growth factors and nutrients, playing a critical role in cell proliferation and quiescence exit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEAR STRESS<|>MECHANISM<|>Shear stress is a mechanical force exerted by fluid flow on cells, influencing their morphology, adhesion, and quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB-E2F BISTABLE SWITCH<|>MECHANISM<|>The Rb-E2F bistable switch is a regulatory mechanism that controls the transition between quiescence and proliferation in response to external signals.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The microfluidic system was used to study the effects of fluid flow on cellular quiescence, demonstrating how external conditions can influence this state in cells.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELL<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Cells can enter a quiescent state, which is a key focus of the study examining how various factors affect this condition.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM<|>CELL<|>The microfluidic system allows for the examination of cellular behaviors, including quiescence, under controlled fluid flow conditions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERUM<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Serum growth signals are critical for quiescence exit, indicating a relationship between serum presence and cellular activity.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEAR STRESS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Shear stress from fluid flow affects cellular quiescence, suggesting a direct relationship between mechanical forces and cell behavior.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RB-E2F BISTABLE SWITCH<|>QUIESCENCE<|>The Rb-E2F bistable switch regulates the transition from quiescence to proliferation, indicating its role in cellular responses to external signals.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
