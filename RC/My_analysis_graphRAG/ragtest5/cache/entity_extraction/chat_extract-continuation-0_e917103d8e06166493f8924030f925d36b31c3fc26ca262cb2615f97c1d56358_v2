It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16].

Whether and howextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affects cellular quiescence remainlargely unknown.In this study, we examined the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth using a micro/uniFB02uidic systemwith a controllable medium/uniFB02\now rate. First, we found manyquiescence characteristics previously observed in cell culturesunder a static medium were also present in the micro/uniFB02uidicsystem under continuous medium/uniFB02ow. Furthermore, themedium/uniFB02ow affected cellular quiescence depth, and thus,the likelihood of cell cycle reentry upon growth stimulation.This result was further explained by the combined effect of/uniFB02ow-induced hydrodynamic shear stress and extracellularsubstance replacement. Lastly, the experimental resultswere integrated into a mathematic model that helpsunderstand and predict how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02owmodulates quiescence depth.To the best of our knowledge,this study is the/uniFB01rst to characterize the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence, which could help betterunderstand the heterogeneous response of quiescent cells fortissue repair and regenerationin different physiologicalcontexts of living tissues.MATERIAL AND METHODSMicro/uniFB02uidic Device Design and Fabrication\nA micro/uniFB02uidic system was developed to study cellular quiescenceunder medium/uniFB02ow.

In particular, we\n\nfound that lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass (in-\n\ndicated by the intensity of lysosomal staining and the number of\n\nlysosomes per cell) continuously increase as quiescence deepens;\n\nhowever, autophagy flux decreases. Lysosomes are hydrolytic\n\nenzyme-filled organelles in the cell that break down many types of\n\nbiomolecules; lysosomal function, primarily through processes of\n\nautophagy and endocytosis, has been shown to prevent irreversible\n\ncellular states, such as senescenc\ne, terminal differentiation, and\n\nSignificance\nReactivating sleep-like quiescent cells in the body (most nota-\n\nbly stem cells) to divide is fundamental to tissue homeostasis\n\nand regeneration.

We show that lysosomal\nfunction, like a dimmer switch, cont\ninuously regulates quiescence\n\ndepth and thus the proliferative potential of quiescent cells by re-\n\nducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We\n\nfound that a set of\n\n“\nsenescence core signature\n”\ngenes (19) show\n\nsimilar expression patterns in deep quiescence as in senescence, and\nthat a gene-expression signature w\ne developed to indicate cellular\n\nquiescence depth by comparing deep and shallow quiescent REF\n\ncells is able to correctly classify senescent and aging cells in a wide\narray of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo (22, 23),\n\nsuggesting that deep quiescence may serve as a common transition\n\npath from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\n\nResults\nDynamic Transcriptome Changes during Quiescence Deepening.\nSimilar\n\nto our previous observation (14), REF cells moved into deeper\nquiescence progressively with longer-term serum starvation. After\n2-d serum starvation, the entire cell population entered quiescence, as\n\ndemonstrated by their negative D\nNA incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2\n′\n-\n\ndeoxyuridine (EdU) and a complete shut-off of E2f1 expression (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S1\n B\n). E2f1 is a member of the E2f family of tran-\n\nscription factors; it up-regulates a large battery of genes involved in\n\nDNA replication and cell cycle progression, acting as the key ef-\n\nfector of an Rb-E2f bistable switch that controls the all-or-none\ntransition from quiescence to proliferation (24, 25). With in-\n\ncreasingly longer serum starvati\non, cells moved into deeper quies-\n\ncence, requiring a longer time and a greater serum stimulation\nstrength (concentration) to reen\nter the cell cycle than cells in\n\nshallower quiescence. For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a reversible state where cells are inactive and do not proliferate, often influenced by external factors such as serum starvation, and can exhibit varying depths affecting their reentry into the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal function involves the breakdown and recycling of biomolecules, which plays a crucial role in regulating quiescence depth and preventing irreversible cellular states like senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>MECHANISM<|>Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, which decreases as quiescence deepens, impacting lysosomal mass and function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>PHENOTYPE<|>Senescence is a state where cells permanently cease to divide, often as a response to stress or damage, and can be related to deep quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>OXIDATIVE STRESS<|>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules that can cause cellular damage, and their accumulation is reduced by lysosomal function during quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDU<|>PHENOTYPE<|>EdU is a nucleoside analog used to label newly synthesized DNA, indicating cell proliferation and the ability of cells to reenter the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of living organisms, which can enter quiescence and are influenced by various factors such as serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>Lysosomal function regulates quiescence depth by managing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, indicating a direct relationship between these two entities<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Deep quiescence may represent a transition path to senescence, suggesting a relationship between these two cellular states<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>Decreased autophagy flux leads to increased lysosomal mass, indicating a relationship between these mechanisms<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>Lysosomal function helps reduce ROS accumulation, establishing a relationship between oxidative stress and lysosomal activity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELL<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Cells can enter a quiescent state under serum starvation, indicating a relationship between cell behavior and quiescence<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDU<|>CELL<|>EdU labeling indicates that cells are reentering the cell cycle, showing a relationship between cell proliferation and EdU<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
