Shear stress, generated by extracellular fluid flow, affects both the activation threshold and the depth of quiescence in these cells. This indicates a significant interplay between mechanical forces and the dynamics of cellular quiescence. Specifically, shear stress can promote the exit from quiescence, suggesting that the mechanical environment plays a crucial role in regulating cellular states. Overall, the data highlights the importance of shear stress in modulating quiescence dynamics, emphasizing its impact on cell behavior and the potential for mechanical forces to influence cellular states.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966713, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 417, "total_tokens": 553, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
