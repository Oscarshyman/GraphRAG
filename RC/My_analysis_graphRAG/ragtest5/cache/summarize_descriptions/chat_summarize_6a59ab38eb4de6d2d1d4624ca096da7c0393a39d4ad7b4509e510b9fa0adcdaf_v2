Conversely, a reduction in oxidative stress has been shown to prevent the deepening of quiescence. This indicates a strong correlation, as the depth of quiescence is positively associated with oxidative stress levels; thus, higher oxidative stress can lead to a more profound state of quiescence. Overall, these findings highlight the critical role that oxidative stress plays in modulating the quiescent state of cells.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966713, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
