Specifically, extracellular flow influences the depth of cellular quiescence, suggesting that variations in fluid movement can alter the state of cells. This interaction indicates that extracellular flow can induce a shallower quiescence in cells, further emphasizing the connection between the physical properties of the extracellular environment and the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular states. Overall, the interplay between extracellular flow and quiescence underscores the importance of understanding how mechanical forces can shape cellular behavior in the context of biomedicine.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966714, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
