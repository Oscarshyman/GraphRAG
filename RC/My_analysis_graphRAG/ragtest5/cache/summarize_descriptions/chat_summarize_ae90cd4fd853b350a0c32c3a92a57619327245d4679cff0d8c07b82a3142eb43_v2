These undifferentiated cells play a vital role in brain repair and regeneration, contributing significantly to the maintenance and recovery of the nervous system. They possess the unique capability of self-renewal, allowing them to proliferate and generate new cells as needed. Additionally, neural stem cells can enter a quiescent state, which affects their activation and functional response, particularly during aging and following injury. This ability to remain dormant yet rapidly reenter the cell cycle when required underscores their importance in neuroprotection and recovery processes within the brain.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966706, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 518, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
