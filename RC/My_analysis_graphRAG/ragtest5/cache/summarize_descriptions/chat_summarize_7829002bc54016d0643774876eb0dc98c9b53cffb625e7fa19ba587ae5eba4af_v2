Quiescent cells have the potential to reenter the cell cycle, a process that is evidenced by EdU labeling. This labeling serves as a marker indicating that cells are exiting quiescence and resuming proliferation. The descriptions collectively highlight a direct relationship between quiescence and cell proliferation, emphasizing that EdU labeling is a crucial tool for demonstrating the ability of quiescent cells to transition back into active cell division. Thus, the interplay between quiescence and cell cycle reentry is underscored by the use of EdU as a marker for cellular activity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966713, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 478, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
