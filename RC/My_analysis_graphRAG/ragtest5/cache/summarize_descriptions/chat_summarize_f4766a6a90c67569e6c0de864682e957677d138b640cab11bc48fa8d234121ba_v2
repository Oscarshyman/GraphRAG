This relationship highlights how fluid dynamics and physical cues can modulate cellular dormancy, with extracellular fluid flow inducing varying levels of quiescence. Specifically, it has been observed that such flow can lead to shallow quiescence in cells, demonstrating the impact of both physical and biochemical cues on their quiescent states. Overall, the interplay between extracellular fluid flow and cellular quiescence underscores the importance of mechanical conditions in regulating cellular behavior and states of dormancy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966713, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 402, "total_tokens": 526, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
