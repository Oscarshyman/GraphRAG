These cells have the unique ability to enter a quiescent state, allowing them to remain inactive until needed. Upon tissue injury, MuSCs can rapidly reenter the cell cycle to facilitate repair and regeneration of muscle tissue. However, it is important to note that with age or under conditions of stress, these muscle stem cells can transition into a state of senescence, which may impair their regenerative capabilities. Thus, MuSCs are essential for maintaining muscle health and function, particularly in response to injury, while their functionality can be compromised by aging and stress factors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966704, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
