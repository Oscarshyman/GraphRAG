These transcription factors are essential for the progression of the cell cycle, and their activity is tightly regulated. In quiescent cells, E2F is inhibited by non-phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which prevents the transcription of genes necessary for cell cycle progression. This regulation ensures that cells only enter the active proliferation phase when appropriate signals are present, highlighting the importance of E2F in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to growth signals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966705, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 345, "total_tokens": 477, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
