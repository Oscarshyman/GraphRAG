This process demonstrates how nutrient deprivation leads to a non-dividing state, characterized by cell cycle arrest and reduced cellular activity. The consistent findings across multiple descriptions emphasize that serum starvation not only triggers quiescence but also underscores the importance of nutrient levels in regulating cellular behavior. Thus, serum starvation serves as a key method for inducing quiescence, illustrating the profound impact of nutrient availability on the quiescent state of cells.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966712, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 469, "total_tokens": 581, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
