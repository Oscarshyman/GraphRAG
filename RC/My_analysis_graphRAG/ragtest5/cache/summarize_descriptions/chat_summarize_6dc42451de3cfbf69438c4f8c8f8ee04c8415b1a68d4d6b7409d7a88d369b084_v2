Additionally, CQ deepens quiescence and increases levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), further influencing cellular dynamics. Through these mechanisms, CQ demonstrates its potential to impact various biological processes and therapeutic strategies in biomedical research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966706, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 97, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
