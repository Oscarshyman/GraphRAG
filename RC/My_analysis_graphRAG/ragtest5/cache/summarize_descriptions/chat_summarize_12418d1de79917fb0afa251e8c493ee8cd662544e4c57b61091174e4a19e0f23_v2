Dysregulation of quiescence depth can significantly disrupt tissue homeostasis, resulting in either insufficient growth or depletion of quiescent cells. This underscores the critical role that quiescence plays in maintaining the balance of tissue environments. Furthermore, quiescence enables cells to endure stress, further emphasizing its importance in sustaining tissue homeostasis. Thus, the relationship between quiescence and tissue homeostasis is vital for ensuring proper cellular function and overall tissue integrity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966711, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 420, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
