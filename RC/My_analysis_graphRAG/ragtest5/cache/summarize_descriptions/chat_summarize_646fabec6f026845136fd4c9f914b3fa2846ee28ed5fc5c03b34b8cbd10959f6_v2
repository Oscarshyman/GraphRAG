This quiescent state allows MuSCs to maintain their stem cell properties and respond effectively to muscle injury. Under conditions of stress, however, MuSCs can transition from quiescence to senescence, which may impact their regenerative capabilities. Thus, the relationship between MuSCs and quiescence is critical for understanding their role in muscle repair and the overall dynamics of muscle tissue homeostasis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966711, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
