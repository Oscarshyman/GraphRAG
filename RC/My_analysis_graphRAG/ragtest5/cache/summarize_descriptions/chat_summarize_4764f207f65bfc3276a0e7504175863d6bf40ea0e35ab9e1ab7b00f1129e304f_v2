It has been shown to induce shallow quiescence in cells when exposed to extracellular fluid flow, primarily due to its viscosity-dependent shear stress effects. Additionally, dextran can promote the exit from quiescence under specific conditions, such as the presence of medium flow. Its impact on cellular quiescence is further highlighted when used in serum-starvation medium, where it affects the depth of quiescence in cells and their subsequent ability to reenter the cell cycle upon serum stimulation. Overall, dextran serves as a valuable tool in studying the mechanisms of cellular quiescence and the responses of cells to varying environmental conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966708, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 512, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
