Specifically, dextran, a polysaccharide, plays a significant role in modulating cellular inactivity, particularly in serum-starvation conditions. It has been observed that dextran affects the viscosity and shear stress of the serum-starvation medium, which in turn impacts the quiescence depth of cells. Under flow conditions, dextran leads to shallower quiescence, suggesting that it promotes the exit from quiescence. This indicates that dextran not only influences the state of cellular quiescence but also plays a critical role in the dynamics of quiescence exit, highlighting its importance as a growth factor in cellular behavior.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966715, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 346, "total_tokens": 500, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
