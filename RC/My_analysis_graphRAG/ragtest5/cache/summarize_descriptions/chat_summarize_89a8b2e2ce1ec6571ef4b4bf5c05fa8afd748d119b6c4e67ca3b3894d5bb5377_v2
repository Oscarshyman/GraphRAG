Impairment of lysosomal function has been shown to deepen quiescence, indicating that lysosomal activity plays a crucial role in determining how deeply cells can enter this state. Furthermore, lysosomal function modulates quiescence by regulating oxidative stress levels and managing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. This suggests that changes in lysosomal activity not only affect quiescence depth but also highlight a direct relationship between these two mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of lysosomal function in cellular quiescence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966711, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 349, "total_tokens": 481, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
