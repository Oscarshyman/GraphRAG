The descriptions indicate that EdU labeling is a reliable indicator of cells reentering the cell cycle, thereby demonstrating a clear relationship between cell proliferation and EdU incorporation. This suggests that the presence of EdU in cells can be used to assess their activity in the cell cycle, highlighting its significance in studies related to cellular growth and division.
