This mechanical force affects cell morphology, adhesion, and the dynamics of quiescence, which is the state of dormancy in cells. Specifically, shear stress can promote the exit from quiescence and impact the depth of quiescence, thereby influencing a cell's activation thresholds and proliferation potential. In microfluidic systems, the effects of shear stress are particularly significant, as they can dictate how cells respond to their fluid environment, ultimately affecting their behavior and reentry into the cell cycle. Overall, shear stress is a vital factor in understanding cellular responses in fluidic contexts, highlighting its importance in biomedical research and applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743966708, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 475, "total_tokens": 631, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
