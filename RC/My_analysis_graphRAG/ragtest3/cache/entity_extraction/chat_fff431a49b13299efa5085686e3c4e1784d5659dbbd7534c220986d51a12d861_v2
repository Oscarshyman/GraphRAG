Blocking p16INK4aactivation prevents the\nquiescence-to-senescence transition only in a subset of cells [13], suggesting the involvement\nof other molecular effectors driving the quiescence-origin senescence. Furthermore, is\nlysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition\nto senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb–E2F switch threshold—or\npossibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream\nE2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]? Growing cells exiting from either\nthe G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle converge onto the same senescent state with a G1-like\nmolecular signature [76]. How about quiescence-origin senescence? What are its molecular\nmarkers, and to what extent do they overlap with or differ from the markers of proliferation-\norigin senescence, beyond the sustained (if not totally irreversible) arrested phenotype\n(Figure 1)? Future investigations are needed to ﬁnd the answers.\n4. Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCS<|>CELL<|>MuSCs (muscle stem cells) are involved in the activation process through epigenetic derepression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HSPCS<|>CELL<|>HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) are activated via p38 MAPK hyperactivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>p16INK4a is a molecular marker that, when blocked, prevents the quiescence-to-senescence transition in a subset of cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>BIOCHEMICAL CUES<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a biochemical cue that may trigger quiescence deepening and transition to senescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB-E2F SWITCH<|>CELL CYCLE<|>The Rb–E2F switch is a critical regulatory point in the cell cycle that may be influenced by quiescence and senescence processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S PHASE<|>CELL CYCLE<|>S phase is a stage in the cell cycle where DNA replication occurs, and its entry may be regulated by quiescence and senescence mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL PROLIFERATION<|>CELL CYCLE<|>Cell proliferation refers to the process of cell division and growth, which can be affected by senescence and quiescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including quiescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>AGING<|>Aging is a biological process characterized by a gradual decline in cellular function and an increase in senescent cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is a field of biomedical research focused on understanding the mechanisms of cancer development and progression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Regenerative medicine is a branch of biomedical research aimed at repairing or replacing damaged tissues and organs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCS<|>P16INK4A<|>p16INK4a is involved in the quiescence-to-senescence transition in MuSCs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HSPCS<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>HSPCs are activated through p38 MAPK hyperactivation, which may relate to lysosomal autophagy processes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal autophagy may trigger quiescence deepening, affecting the transition to senescence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>AGING<|>Senescence contributes to the aging process by increasing the number of irreversibly arrested cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Understanding quiescence and senescence has implications for both cancer biology and regenerative medicine<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, biochemical cues, molecular markers, cell cycle, quiescence, senescence, aging, lysosome, extracellular flow, stem cells, gene expression, mechanotransduction, physiological phenomena, diseases, biomedical research]\ntext:\n and senescence as a dimmer\n\nswitch.

Quiescence protects cells against stress and\nirreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many\nphysiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and\n\ntissue repair (1\n\n–\n4).

For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60% EdU\n+\nrate) (Fig. 1\nA\nand\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S1\n C\n),\n\nand the serum concentration req\nuired for cell cycle reentry in-\n\ncreased from\n\n<\n2% to\n∼\n8% (to achieve\n∼\n60% EdU\n+\nmeasured at\n\nthe 25th hour of serum stimulation) (Fig. 1\n\nB\n). This result is con-\n\nsistent with our earlier findings that the time and serum threshold\nrequired for cell cycle reentry are 2\nrelated features that both reflect\n\nthe same biological state, the quiescence depth (14). Importantly,\n\ndeep quiescent cells were not irre\nversibly arrested. For example,\n\nupon 20% serum stimulation, 92.\n6% of 16-d serum-starved deep\n\nquiescent REF cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU\n+\n)\n\nwithin 41 h (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S1\n B\n).\n\nTo identify molecular mechanisms regulating quiescence\ndepth at the transcriptional level, we performed RNA-sequencing\n\n(RNA-seq) analysis of 0- to 16-d serum-starved cells (26). As\n\nexpected, the expression of well-characterized proliferation\ngenes\n\n—\nsuch as E2f1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 (\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n A\n)\n—\n\n\nE2f1 target genes (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n B\n), and proliferation-\n\nrelated gene clusters (#7 and 9,\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n C\n)was\n\nquickly down-regulated within 2-d serum starvation. Conversely,\nthe expression of growth inhibitory genes, such as Rb1, Cdkn1a\n(p21Cip1), and Cdkn1b (p27Kip1), was up-regulated upon se-\n\nrum starvation (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n A\n). The expression of Cdkn2a\n\n(p16INK4A), a senescence marker (27), remained low as cells\nmoved deeper in quiescence (3- to 16-d serum starvation) (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S2\n D\n), consistent with quiescence being a\n\nreversible state.\n\nThe global gene-expression profile changed drastically when\ncells transitioned from proliferation to quiescence (0- to 2-d\n\nserum starvation) and continued to change sequentially as cells\n\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (2- to 16-d serum star-\nvation) (Fig. 1\n\nC\n). This sequential change was reflected in 9 gene\n\nclusters that exhibited different temporal dynamic patterns (Fig.\n\n2\n\nA\nand\nB\n). In particular, the expression of 2 gene clusters\n\nappeared to be positively correlated with quiescence deepening\nand increased monotonically as cells moved from shallow to\n\ndeep quiescence (clusters 1 and 3) (Fig. 2\n\nB\n). In cluster 1, mul-\n\ntiple biological functions were enriched; among them, lysosome\n\nwas overall the most statistically significant in Kyoto Encyclo-\n\npedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) overrepresentation tests\n\n[Fig. 2\n\nC\n, using clusterProfiler (28);\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n, using\n\nDAVID (29)]. In cluster 3, lysosome was the single function\n\nsignificantly enriched statistically (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n). Con-\n\nsistently, lysosomal genes also had the strongest positive corre-\n\nlation with deep quiescence in gene set enrichment analysis\n\n(GSEA) (30) (normalized enrichment score [NES]\n\n=\n3.12)\n\n(Fig. 2\n\nD\n).\n\nLysosomal Gene Expression and Lysosomal Mass Increase as Quiescence\n\nDeepens.\nThe vast majority of lysosomal genes, encoding for various\n\nlysosomal enzymes, activator proteins, membrane proteins, and ion\n\nchannel proteins, increased their expression continuously as cells\n\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (Fig. 2\n\nE\n[cluster C and the\n\nbottom half of cluster A], Fig. 2\n\nF\n,and\n SI Appendix\n,Fig.S3\n A\n). As a\n\ncomparison, the expression of most genes associated with endo-\n\nsomes, another cellular organelle in the endosomal\n\n–\nlysosomal sys-\n\ntem, only increased significantly during the first 2 d of serum\n\nstarvation but not afterward as quiescence continued to deepen\n(Fig. 2\n\nF\nand\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S3\n B\nand\nC\n).\n\nLysosomal mass also increased in deep quiescence: Following\n\na brief pulsatile adaptive response (within the first 6 h) upon\n\nserum starvation, lysosomal mass continuously increased over\n\nthe next 14 d, as seen from the stained LysoTracker intensity\n\n(Fig. 2\n\nG\n). The initial pulsatile response of lysosomal mass was\n\nlikely due to an adaptive mammalian target of rapamycin\n(mTOR)-autophagy response to serum starvation, as previously\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
