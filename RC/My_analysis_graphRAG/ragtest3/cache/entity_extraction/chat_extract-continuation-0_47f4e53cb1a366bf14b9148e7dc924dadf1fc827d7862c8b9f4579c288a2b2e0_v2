Furthermore, is\nlysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition\nto senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb–E2F switch threshold—or\npossibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream\nE2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]?

Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1).

Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCS<|>CELL<|>MuSCs (muscle stem cells) are involved in the activation process through epigenetic derepression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HSPCS<|>CELL<|>HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) are activated via p38 MAPK hyperactivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>p16INK4a is a molecular marker that, when blocked, prevents the quiescence-to-senescence transition in a subset of cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>BIOCHEMICAL CUES<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a biochemical cue that may trigger quiescence deepening and transition to senescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB-E2F SWITCH<|>CELL CYCLE<|>The Rb–E2F switch is a critical regulatory point in the cell cycle that may be influenced by quiescence and senescence processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S PHASE<|>CELL CYCLE<|>S phase is a stage in the cell cycle where DNA replication occurs, and its entry may be regulated by quiescence and senescence mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL PROLIFERATION<|>CELL CYCLE<|>Cell proliferation refers to the process of cell division and growth, which can be affected by senescence and quiescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including quiescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>AGING<|>Aging is a biological process characterized by a gradual decline in cellular function and an increase in senescent cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is a field of biomedical research focused on understanding the mechanisms of cancer development and progression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Regenerative medicine is a branch of biomedical research aimed at repairing or replacing damaged tissues and organs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCS<|>P16INK4A<|>p16INK4a is involved in the quiescence-to-senescence transition in MuSCs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HSPCS<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>HSPCs are activated through p38 MAPK hyperactivation, which may relate to lysosomal autophagy processes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal autophagy may trigger quiescence deepening, affecting the transition to senescence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>AGING<|>Senescence contributes to the aging process by increasing the number of irreversibly arrested cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Understanding quiescence and senescence has implications for both cancer biology and regenerative medicine<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, biochemical cues, molecular markers, cell cycle, quiescence, senescence, aging, lysosome, extracellular flow, stem cells, gene expression, mechanotransduction, physiological phenomena, diseases, biomedical research]\ntext:\n and senescence as a dimmer\n\nswitch. Finally, we found that a gene-\nexpression signature developed\n\nby comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can cor-\nrectly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro\n\nand in vivo, suggesting that while qui\nescence is generally considered\n\nto protect cells from irreversible a\nrrest of senescence, quiescence\n\ndeepening likely represents a common transition path from cell pro-\nliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\nquiescence\n|\ndormancy\n|\nsenescence\n|\naging\n|\nlysosome\n\nC\nell proliferation in multicellular organisms is tightly regu-\n\nlated, and the vast majority of cells in the body stay dormant\n\nand out of the cell cycle at any given moment.

Quiescence protects cells against stress and\nirreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many\nphysiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and\n\ntissue repair (1\n\n–\n4).

We have\nshown that the Rb–E2F switch threshold can be modulated by multiple factors in the\nRb–E2F pathway with varying degrees of sensitivity with those associated with G1 cyclins\nand cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) being the most prominent [28].\nThe Rb–E2F switch is the ﬁrst bistable switch that cells encounter during the transition\nfrom quiescence to proliferation in response to mitogens, and it connects to downstream\nbistable switches and checkpoints regulating S phase entry [67,68]. Given that the Rb–E2F\npathway interacts with other quiescence regulatory pathways (e.g., Notch–Hes1, p53–p21,\nPI3K–Akt, DNA damage response, LKB1–AMPK, and microRNA) [10,27,63], we propose\nthat the Rb–E2F switch serves as a core hub that integrates cellular signals to quantitatively\ndetermine the growth stimulation level required for the all-or-none cell cycle re-entry. In\nparallel, other cellular pathways impinge on the Rb–E2F switch and modulate its switch\nthreshold. This modulatory effect may occur through crosstalk with various gene nodes in\nthe Rb–E2F switch network, most effectively by affecting G1 cyclin and CDK activities in\nthe cell [13,28,69]. Higher thresholds lead to deeper quiescence and, eventually, senescence\nwhen physiological growth signals can no longer overcome the threshold [27,41]. Therefore,\nthe difference between deep quiescence and senescence lies primarily in the magnitude of\nthe Rb–E2F switch threshold rather than in fundamentally distinct cellular characteristics,\naligning with the quiescence–senescence continuum model.\nThe lysosomal–autophagy axis discussed above driving quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition in MuSCs directly increases the Rb–E2F switch threshold (by activating p16 that\ninhibits CDK activity) [13,18]. Similarly, increasing the Rb–E2F switch threshold has been\nreported to drive deep quiescence in MuSCs via fasting-induced ketone body signaling (by\nincreasing p21 that inhibits CDK) [69]. This threshold mechanism predicts a potential way\nto reverse the “irreversible” senescence by reducing the Rb–E2F switch threshold. Indeed,\nstudies have shown that senescent cells can be reactivated as such, e.g., by inactivating Rb,\np53–p21, or p16 activities [70–75] or by the forced G1 cyclin upregulation [76].\n3.3. Remaining Unknowns and the Heterogeneity in Quiescence-Origin Senescence\nSeveral key areas remain to be explored. The role of mTOR signaling, for instance,\npresents an intriguing paradox. mTOR is a major driver of proliferation-origin senescence,\nunderlying the process of geroconversion—a process in which mTOR-driven cell growth\ncontinues aberrantly after the cell cycle is blocked (e.g., by CDK inhibitors p21CIP1/Waf1 and\np16INK4a) [11,77]. In quiescence, mTOR is inactive and cells lack sustained growth, which\nhas been proposed as a mechanism to protect quiescent cells against senescence [11,77]. This\nquestions the involvement of mTOR in quiescence deepening and the quiescence-origin\nsenescence, which aligns with the fact that mTOR activity is linked to shallow quiescence\n(GAlert) [42], not quiescence deepening. Therefore, the quiescence-origin senescence appears\ndifferent from proliferation-origin senescence from the aspect of mTOR and geroconversion\n(Figure 1).Biomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 5 of 8\n\n\nFigure 1.Quiescence-origin senescence. Conventional senescence originates from proliferating and\ngrowing cells via mTOR-mediated geroconversion, when cell growth continues aberrantly after the\ncell cycle is blocked in response to severe stress and damage. In comparison, quiescence-origin\nsenescence originates from quiescent cells via quiescence deepening, accompanied by a progressively\nincreasing Rb–E2F switch threshold in response to decreased lysosomal autophagy and increased ROS\naccumulation and protein aggregation. Senescent cells are irreversibly arrested under physiological\nconditions. Deep quiescent cells are reversible but require stronger growth stimulation and take a\nlonger time to re-enter the cell cycle than shallow quiescent cells. The boundary between very deep\nquiescence and quiescence-origin senescence (the red dashed line) is blurred.\nEpigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in proliferation-origin senescence, including\nthe formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) that repress E2F target\ngenes [78] and changes in DNA methylation and histone modiﬁcationpatterns [79,80].\nEpigenetic mechanisms are also involved in quiescence deepening and transition to senes-\ncence, as seen in the ROS-mediated derepression of the p16 locus [18] and the role of ketone\nbody-mediated acetylation and activation of the p53 locus [69] in MuSCs as\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>E2F<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>E2F is a family of transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle and are crucial for the transition from quiescence to proliferation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>Rb (Retinoblastoma protein) is a key regulator of the cell cycle that inhibits E2F activity in quiescent cells, preventing cell cycle progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of dormancy in which cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle in response to growth signals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>BIOCHEMICAL CUES<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, playing a role in the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CDK<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulators of the cell cycle that, when inhibited, can prevent the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCS<|>CELL<|>MuSCs (muscle stem cells) are involved in the activation process and can transition between quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEROCONVERSION<|>CELL CYCLE<|>Geroconversion is a process where cells continue to grow aberrantly after the cell cycle is blocked, often linked to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROS<|>BIOCHEMICAL CUES<|>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules that can contribute to cellular stress and the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RB<|>E2F<|>Rb inhibits E2F activity in quiescent cells, preventing cell cycle progression and linking the two entities in the regulation of the cell cycle<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence can protect cells from irreversible arrest, such as senescence, indicating a relationship between the two states<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal autophagy is involved in the quiescence-to-senescence transition, affecting the Rb–E2F switch threshold<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MuSCs can transition between quiescence and senescence, indicating their role in cellular aging processes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROS<|>SENESCENCE<|>Increased ROS accumulation is linked to the transition from quiescence to senescence, suggesting a biochemical relationship<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CDK<|>SENESCENCE<|>Inhibition of CDK activity can prevent the transition from quiescence to senescence, linking these molecular markers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEROCONVERSION<|>SENESCENCE<|>Geroconversion is associated with proliferation-origin senescence, indicating a relationship between these processes<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
