Blocking p16INK4aactivation prevents the\nquiescence-to-senescence transition only in a subset of cells [13], suggesting the involvement\nof other molecular effectors driving the quiescence-origin senescence. Furthermore, is\nlysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition\nto senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb–E2F switch threshold—or\npossibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream\nE2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]? Growing cells exiting from either\nthe G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle converge onto the same senescent state with a G1-like\nmolecular signature [76]. How about quiescence-origin senescence? What are its molecular\nmarkers, and to what extent do they overlap with or differ from the markers of proliferation-\norigin senescence, beyond the sustained (if not totally irreversible) arrested phenotype\n(Figure 1)? Future investigations are needed to ﬁnd the answers.\n4. Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCS<|>CELL<|>MuSCs (muscle stem cells) are involved in the activation process through epigenetic derepression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HSPCS<|>CELL<|>HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) are activated via p38 MAPK hyperactivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>p16INK4a is a molecular marker that, when blocked, prevents the quiescence-to-senescence transition in a subset of cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>BIOCHEMICAL CUES<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a biochemical cue that may trigger quiescence deepening and transition to senescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB-E2F SWITCH<|>CELL CYCLE<|>The Rb–E2F switch is a critical regulatory point in the cell cycle that may be influenced by quiescence and senescence processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S PHASE<|>CELL CYCLE<|>S phase is a stage in the cell cycle where DNA replication occurs, and its entry may be regulated by quiescence and senescence mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL PROLIFERATION<|>CELL CYCLE<|>Cell proliferation refers to the process of cell division and growth, which can be affected by senescence and quiescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including quiescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>AGING<|>Aging is a biological process characterized by a gradual decline in cellular function and an increase in senescent cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is a field of biomedical research focused on understanding the mechanisms of cancer development and progression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Regenerative medicine is a branch of biomedical research aimed at repairing or replacing damaged tissues and organs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCS<|>P16INK4A<|>p16INK4a is involved in the quiescence-to-senescence transition in MuSCs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HSPCS<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>HSPCs are activated through p38 MAPK hyperactivation, which may relate to lysosomal autophagy processes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal autophagy may trigger quiescence deepening, affecting the transition to senescence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>AGING<|>Senescence contributes to the aging process by increasing the number of irreversibly arrested cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Understanding quiescence and senescence has implications for both cancer biology and regenerative medicine<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, biochemical cues, molecular markers, cell cycle, quiescence, senescence, aging, lysosome, extracellular flow, stem cells, gene expression, mechanotransduction, physiological phenomena, diseases, biomedical research]\ntext:\n and senescence as a dimmer\n\nswitch. Finally, we found that a gene-\nexpression signature developed\n\nby comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can cor-\nrectly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro\n\nand in vivo, suggesting that while qui\nescence is generally considered\n\nto protect cells from irreversible a\nrrest of senescence, quiescence\n\ndeepening likely represents a common transition path from cell pro-\nliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\nquiescence\n|\ndormancy\n|\nsenescence\n|\naging\n|\nlysosome\n\nC\nell proliferation in multicellular organisms is tightly regu-\n\nlated, and the vast majority of cells in the body stay dormant\n\nand out of the cell cycle at any given moment. The dormant\n\nstate, when reversible upon growth signals, is referred to as\n\ncellular quiescence. Quiescence protects cells against stress and\nirreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many\nphysiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and\n\ntissue repair (1\n\n–\n4). Consequently, dysregulation of cellular qui-\n\nescence can lead to a range of hyper- and hypoproliferative\ndiseases, including cancer and aging (5\n\n–\n7).\n\nIt becomes increasingly recognized that quiescence is a het-\n\nerogeneous state with graded depth. For example, following in-\njury, muscle and neural stem cells at noninjury sites in the body\nmove adaptively into shallower quiescence (alert or primed\n\nquiescent phase), positioning cells to more quickly respond to\n\ninjury and reenter the cell cycle when needed (8, 9). In other\ncases, cells move into deep quiescence and require stronger\n\ngrowth stimulation and longer times to reenter the cell cycle, as\n\nseen in hepatocytes upon partial hepatectomy in older rats than\nin younger ones (10, 11). Similarly, the quiescent state deepens\nin cells that are cultured longer under quiescence-inducing sig-\n\nnals, such as contact inhibition (12, 13) and serum starvation\n(14).
