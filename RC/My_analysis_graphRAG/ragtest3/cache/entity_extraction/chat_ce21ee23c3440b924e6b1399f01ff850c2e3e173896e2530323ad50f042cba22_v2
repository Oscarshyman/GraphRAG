Blocking p16INK4aactivation prevents the\nquiescence-to-senescence transition only in a subset of cells [13], suggesting the involvement\nof other molecular effectors driving the quiescence-origin senescence. Furthermore, is\nlysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition\nto senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb–E2F switch threshold—or\npossibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream\nE2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]? Growing cells exiting from either\nthe G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle converge onto the same senescent state with a G1-like\nmolecular signature [76]. How about quiescence-origin senescence? What are its molecular\nmarkers, and to what extent do they overlap with or differ from the markers of proliferation-\norigin senescence, beyond the sustained (if not totally irreversible) arrested phenotype\n(Figure 1)? Future investigations are needed to ﬁnd the answers.\n4. Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1).

Recent research, however, has revealed a novel pathway termed “quiescence-\norigin senescence”, where cells directly transition into senescence from the quiescent state, bypassing\ncell proliferation and growth. This opinion paper presents a framework conceptualizing a continuum\nbetween quiescence and senescence with quiescence deepening as a precursor to senescence entry.\nWe explore the triggers and controllers of this process and discuss its biological implications. Given\nthat the majority of cells in the human body are dormant rather than proliferative, understanding\nquiescence-origin senescence has signiﬁcant implications for tissue homeostasis, aging, cancer, and\nvarious disease processes. The new paradigm in exploring this previously overlooked senescent cell\npopulation may reshape our intervention strategies for age-related diseases and tissue regeneration.\nKeywords:quiescence; senescence; quiescence deepening; dormancy state continuum; Rb–E2F\nswitch threshold; geroconversion\n\n1. Introduction\nCellular senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, has been a focal point\nof biomedical research for decades [1]. It is typically triggered when growing cells are\noverwhelmed by extensive stresses and damage, such as telomere erosion, oncogene\nactivation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, to a degree beyond their repair capacity [2,3].\nCells enter senescence and permanently halt proliferation to avoid deleterious consequences\nlike malignant tumorigenesis and ﬁbrotic response [4,5]. The hallmarks of senescent cells\ninclude permanent cell cycle arrest, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP),\nmacromolecular damage, deregulated metabolism [6], and often enlarged cell size and\nother morphological changes [2,7]. This conventional view has shaped our understanding\nof senescence primarily as an extreme stress response in proliferating and growing cells.\nIn contrast, cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest. Under physio-\nlogical growth-limiting conditions, such as mitogen withdrawal or contact inhibition, cells\nexit the cell cycle and enter quiescence [8]. Quiescent cells are typically associated with low\nmetabolic activity and reduced cell size and do not exhibit obvious deleterious phenotypes\nassociated with senescence, such as SASP and severe damage [8,9]. Upon restoration of\ngrowth-permissive conditions (e.g., reintroducing growth factors or alleviating contact\ninhibition), quiescent cells can resume proliferation, which is a key distinction from senes-\ncent cells [8,9]. Quiescence is considered a physiological state that allows cells to maintain\ncellular viability and integrity under growth-limiting conditions, playing a crucial role\nin tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance [9,10]. This mechanism is proposed to\nsafeguard cells from senescence [11,12].\nRecent research in the past decade, however, has begun to challenge this traditional\nparadigm by demonstrating that senescence can originate directly from quiescent cells in\n\nBiomedicines2024,12, 1837. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12081837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicinesBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 2 of 8\n\nvarious contexts [13–16]. This phenomenon, which we term “quiescence-origin senescence”,\nsuggests a ﬂuid continuum between quiescence and senescence with profound implications\nfor tissue homeostasis, aging, and disease processes. Notably, proliferating cells account\nfor less than 1% of the thirty-seven trillion cells in the human body at any given time [17],\nsuggesting that quiescence-origin senescence may underlie a large proportion of previously\noverlooked or misclassiﬁed senescent cells.\nThis brief review synthesizes recent ﬁndings to provide a new framework for un-\nderstanding senescence from the perspective of cell dormancy–state plasticity, aiming to\nstimulate further related research into novel intervention strategies for age-related diseases,\ncancer, and regenerative medicine.\n2.
