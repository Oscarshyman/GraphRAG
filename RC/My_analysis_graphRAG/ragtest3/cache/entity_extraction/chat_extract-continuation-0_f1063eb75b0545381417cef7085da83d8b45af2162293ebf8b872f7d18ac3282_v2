Blocking p16INK4aactivation prevents the\nquiescence-to-senescence transition only in a subset of cells [13], suggesting the involvement\nof other molecular effectors driving the quiescence-origin senescence. Furthermore, is\nlysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition\nto senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb–E2F switch threshold—or\npossibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream\nE2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]?

Future investigations are needed to ﬁnd the answers.\n4. Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1).

Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCS<|>CELL<|>MuSCs (muscle stem cells) are involved in the activation process through epigenetic derepression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HSPCS<|>CELL<|>HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) are activated via p38 MAPK hyperactivation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>p16INK4a is a molecular marker that, when blocked, prevents the quiescence-to-senescence transition in a subset of cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>BIOCHEMICAL CUES<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a biochemical cue that may trigger quiescence deepening and transition to senescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB-E2F SWITCH<|>CELL CYCLE<|>The Rb–E2F switch is a critical regulatory point in the cell cycle that may be influenced by quiescence and senescence processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S PHASE<|>CELL CYCLE<|>S phase is a stage in the cell cycle where DNA replication occurs, and its entry may be regulated by quiescence and senescence mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL PROLIFERATION<|>CELL CYCLE<|>Cell proliferation refers to the process of cell division and growth, which can be affected by senescence and quiescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including quiescence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>AGING<|>Aging is a biological process characterized by a gradual decline in cellular function and an increase in senescent cells)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is a field of biomedical research focused on understanding the mechanisms of cancer development and progression)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Regenerative medicine is a branch of biomedical research aimed at repairing or replacing damaged tissues and organs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCS<|>P16INK4A<|>p16INK4a is involved in the quiescence-to-senescence transition in MuSCs<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HSPCS<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>HSPCs are activated through p38 MAPK hyperactivation, which may relate to lysosomal autophagy processes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal autophagy may trigger quiescence deepening, affecting the transition to senescence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>AGING<|>Senescence contributes to the aging process by increasing the number of irreversibly arrested cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Understanding quiescence and senescence has implications for both cancer biology and regenerative medicine<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, biochemical cues, molecular markers, cell cycle, quiescence, senescence, aging, lysosome, extracellular flow, stem cells, gene expression, mechanotransduction, physiological phenomena, diseases, biomedical research]\ntext:\n and senescence as a dimmer\n\nswitch. Finally, we found that a gene-\nexpression signature developed\n\nby comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can cor-\nrectly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro\n\nand in vivo, suggesting that while qui\nescence is generally considered\n\nto protect cells from irreversible a\nrrest of senescence, quiescence\n\ndeepening likely represents a common transition path from cell pro-\nliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\nquiescence\n|\ndormancy\n|\nsenescence\n|\naging\n|\nlysosome\n\nC\nell proliferation in multicellular organisms is tightly regu-\n\nlated, and the vast majority of cells in the body stay dormant\n\nand out of the cell cycle at any given moment. The dormant\n\nstate, when reversible upon growth signals, is referred to as\n\ncellular quiescence. Quiescence protects cells against stress and\nirreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many\nphysiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and\n\ntissue repair (1\n\n–\n4). Consequently, dysregulation of cellular qui-\n\nescence can lead to a range of hyper- and hypoproliferative\ndiseases, including cancer and aging (5\n\n–\n7).\n\nIt becomes increasingly recognized that quiescence is a het-\n\nerogeneous state with graded depth.

In other\ncases, cells move into deep quiescence and require stronger\n\ngrowth stimulation and longer times to reenter the cell cycle, as\n\nseen in hepatocytes upon partial hepatectomy in older rats than\nin younger ones (10, 11). Similarly, the quiescent state deepens\nin cells that are cultured longer under quiescence-inducing sig-\n\nnals, such as contact inhibition (12, 13) and serum starvation\n(14).

Among them,\nDNA damage is a likely candidate, which can be caused by\n\nvarious stress signals (e.g., ROS and replication stress) and is\n\nassociated with quiescence entry (64, 65) as well as cellular se-\nnescence (66, 67) and aging (68, 69). Furthermore, many cellular\nactivities are up- or down-regulated as cells move deeper in\n\nquiescence (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n). Some of these cellular ac-\n\ntivities may be involved in the regulation of quiescence depth and\npotentially senescence and aging, with their detailed mechanisms\n\nawaiting further studies. In this regard, it has been shown recently\n\nin both NSCs and bacteria that the accumulation of protein ag-\ngregates is associated with quiescence deepening, and that the\nclearance of protein aggregates (by lysosomes in NSCs and by\n\nDnaK\n\n–\nClpB complex in bacteria) drives cells to shallower quies-\n\ncence and enhances their ability to reenter the cell cycle (39, 70).\nQuiescence entry and exit are regulated by the Rb-E2f-Cyclin/\nCdk gene network (71, 72) that functions as a bistable switch\n\n(25). How does the toggle switch-like nature of the Rb-E2f\n\npathway fit with the lysosomal dimmer switch? We speculate\nthat during quiescence exit, cells first move progressively into\nshallow quiescence and at a time point, the restriction point (73,\n\n74),\n\n“\nflip\n”\ninto the cell cycle by committing to proliferation; the\n\nwhole process acts like adjusting a sliding dimmer before activating\na toggle switch. In this regard, i\nt will be important to figure out\n\nwhether and how the lysosomal switch cross-talks with the Rb-E2f\n\nswitch in controlling quiescence\ndepth and exit in future studies.\n\nRelatedly, recent in vivo studies on muscle and neural stem\ncells generally invoke 2 quiescence state: 1 shallow (e.g., GAlertand primed quiescence) and 1 deep. Our findings that the gene-\nexpression signature we developed in the fibroblast model\n\n22632\n|\nwww.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915905116\n Fujimaki et al.\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA LIBRARY on October 25, 2024 from IP address 128.196.199.13.\n\nin vitro can correctly classify deep (dormant) and shallow (primed)\n\nNSCs in vivo (Fig. 7\n\nA\n) suggest a potential mechanistic link be-\n\ntween the quiescent states in vitro and in vivo. As such, we\n\npredict that quiescence depth in vivo is also continuous instead\nof binary. It is possible that different levels of injuries can cause\nvarying levels of quiescent states in vivo, which was not examined\n\npreviously but would be interesting to test in future studies. Fi-\n\nnally, in support of the continuous quiescence depth in vivo are\nthe earlier findings that in the liver after partial hepatectomy and\n\nin the salivary gland after isoproterenol stimulation, cells in in-\n\ncreasingly older rats took an increasingly longer time to initiate\nDNA synthesis, behaving like cells in increasing deeper quies-\ncence (10, 75).\n\nQuiescence is commonly believed to protect cells from irre-\n\nversible arrest, such as senescence. Our work suggests that this\nprotection declines in long-term quiescent cells and the gradual\nquiescence deepening likely represents a transition path from\n\ncell proliferation to senescence. Relatedly, the same Rb and p53\n\npathways appear to underlie both quiescence and senescence\n(76\n\n–\n79). Whether and how the lysosome\n–\nautophagy pathway\n\ninteracts with Rb and p53 pathways to regulate the transition\n\nfrom deep quiescence to senescence, and whether such a tran-\n\nsition is gradual following a continuum or abrupt as controlled by\nan ultrasensitive or bistable switch-like mechanism (80, 81), re-\n\nmain significant unanswered questions (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S1\nA\n).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nDetailed descriptions of RNA-seq and downstream data analysis and mod-\n\neling, modulation of lysosomal\n\n–\nautophagic function and lysosome bio-\n\ngenesis, assays for quiescence-depth, lysosomal mass and proteolytic activity,\n\nautophagy flux, mitochondrial ROS,\n\nβ\n-galactosidase activity, cell size, and\n\ncytotoxicity are provided in\n\nSI Appendix\n.\n\nCell Culture and Quiescence Induction.\n\nREFs used in this study are from a single-\n\ncell clone derived from REF52 cells and contain a stably integrated human\n\nE2F1 promoter-driven destabilized EGFP (E2f-GFP) reporter, as previously\n\ndescribed [i.e., REF/E23 cells (25, 82)] unless otherwise noted.
