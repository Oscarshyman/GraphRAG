In this state, cells are primed for re-entry into the cell cycle, allowing them to quickly revert to proliferation upon receiving appropriate stimuli. This temporary dormancy contrasts with deeper states of quiescence, as cells in shallow quiescence are more likely to respond to growth signals and can readily transition back into active cell division. Overall, shallow quiescence represents a dynamic equilibrium where cells maintain a balance between dormancy and readiness for proliferation.\",3\n55,CELL PROLIFERATION,\"Cell proliferation is the biological process through which cells divide and grow, playing a crucial role in growth and tissue repair. This process is essential for maintaining healthy cellular function and is influenced by various factors, including quiescence, senescence, and serum growth signals. Quiescence refers to a state of dormancy in which cells are not actively dividing, while senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest that can occur in response to stress or damage. Both of these cellular states can significantly impact the rate and efficiency of cell proliferation. Additionally, regulatory mechanisms and external growth signals further modulate this process, highlighting the complexity and importance of cell proliferation in biological systems.\",6\n225,BACTERIAL DORMANCY,\"Bacterial dormancy refers to a state where bacteria enter a non-replicating phase, which is critical for their survival under stress conditions, such as antibiotic exposure.\",1\n227,AGE-DEPENDENT REGULATION,\"Age-dependent regulation refers to the changes in cellular processes, such as DNA synthesis and proliferation, that occur as organisms age.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n132,SHALLOW QUIESCENCE,DEEP QUIESCENCE,\"Shallow quiescence and deep quiescence are two distinct depths of the quiescent state in cellular biology, highlighting their relationship in terms of cellular responsiveness to stimuli. Deep quiescence necessitates a longer duration and greater serum stimulation for cells to re-enter the cell cycle compared to shallow quiescence. This indicates that while both states are quiescent, they differ significantly in their requirements for reactivation, suggesting a continuum of cellular inactivity that varies in depth and responsiveness.\",20\n111,CELL PROLIFERATION,SHALLOW QUIESCENCE,\"Shallow quiescence allows for a quicker transition back to cell proliferation, indicating a direct relationship\",9\n259,BACTERIAL DORMANCY,CELL PROLIFERATION,\"Bacterial dormancy is a survival strategy that allows bacteria to avoid proliferation under stressful conditions, such as antibiotic treatment.\",7\n264,CELL PROLIFERATION,AGE-DEPENDENT REGULATION,\"Age-dependent regulation affects cell proliferation rates, influencing how cells respond to growth signals as they age.\",7\n\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}}
