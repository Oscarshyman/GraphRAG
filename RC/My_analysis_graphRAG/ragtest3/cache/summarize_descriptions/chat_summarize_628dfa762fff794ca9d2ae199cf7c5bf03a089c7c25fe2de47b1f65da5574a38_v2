It is known to influence cellular behavior, particularly in relation to the depth of quiescence in cell cultures. Under certain conditions, such as higher concentrations in flow medium, dextran can promote the exit from quiescence, thereby impacting cellular dynamics. Its ability to modify viscosity is particularly relevant in serum-starvation media, where it influences shear stress and subsequent cellular responses during biological experiments. Overall, dextran serves as a crucial agent in biomedical research, facilitating the study of cellular behavior under varying physical conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976614, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_9654a743ed", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 392, "total_tokens": 528, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
