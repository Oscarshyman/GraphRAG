This process includes the G1 (gap 1), S (synthesis), G2 (gap 2), and M (mitosis) phases. The cell cycle is intricately regulated by various molecular markers, mechanisms, and signals, which ensure proper progression through the cycle. Additionally, checkpoints are present within the cycle to monitor and regulate the transition between phases, thereby maintaining cellular integrity. The cycle can also be influenced by external signals and the state of the cell, such as quiescence, which is a period of inactivity before the cell resumes proliferation. Overall, the cell cycle is essential for cellular growth, DNA replication, and successful cell division.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976611, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 609, "total_tokens": 765, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
