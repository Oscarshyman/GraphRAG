This state can persist for extended periods, allowing cells to maintain tissue homeostasis and facilitate repair when necessary. During quiescence, cells exhibit low metabolic activity and can exit the cell cycle in response to growth-limiting conditions, such as serum starvation or other external factors. The transition from quiescence to active proliferation is often triggered by growth signals, including growth factors or stimuli related to injury. Overall, quiescence serves as a critical mechanism for cellular regulation, enabling cells to adapt to varying environmental conditions while remaining poised for reactivation when favorable circumstances arise.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976610, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 584, "total_tokens": 738, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
