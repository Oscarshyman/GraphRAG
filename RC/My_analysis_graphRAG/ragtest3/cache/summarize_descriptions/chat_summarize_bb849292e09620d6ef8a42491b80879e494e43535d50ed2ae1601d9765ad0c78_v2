It has been observed that mechanical shear stress can promote the exit from quiescence, suggesting a dynamic interplay between these two entities. Additionally, the depth of quiescence is affected by mechanical shear stress, with higher levels of shear stress resulting in shallower quiescence. This indicates that mechanical shear stress not only facilitates the transition out of a quiescent state but also modulates the extent of quiescence experienced by cells.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976619, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
