In this state, cells exhibit a reduced responsiveness to growth signals and stimuli, making it increasingly difficult for them to re-enter the cell cycle. To exit deep quiescence and resume proliferation, cells require significant or stronger signals, indicating a more irreversible form of dormancy. This state is marked by a decreased likelihood of reactivation, as cells remain dormant for extended periods, necessitating specific conditions to stimulate their re-entry into the cell cycle. Overall, deep quiescence represents a critical phase in cellular regulation, highlighting the intricate balance between dormancy and proliferation in cellular biology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976610, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 509, "total_tokens": 653, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
