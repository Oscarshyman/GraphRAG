This process is essential for maintaining healthy cellular function and is influenced by various factors, including quiescence, senescence, and serum growth signals. Quiescence refers to a state of dormancy in which cells are not actively dividing, while senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest that can occur in response to stress or damage. Both of these cellular states can significantly impact the rate and efficiency of cell proliferation. Additionally, regulatory mechanisms and external growth signals further modulate this process, highlighting the complexity and importance of cell proliferation in biological systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976611, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 452, "total_tokens": 585, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
