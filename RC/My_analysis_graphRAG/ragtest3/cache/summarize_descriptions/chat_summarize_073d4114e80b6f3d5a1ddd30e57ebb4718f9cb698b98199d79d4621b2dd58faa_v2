Higher flow rates are associated with shallower quiescence, which increases the likelihood of cells reentering the cell cycle. This phenomenon occurs because extracellular fluid flow generates both mechanical and biochemical cues that drive cells toward a state of shallow quiescence. These cues play a crucial role in modulating cellular responses to serum growth signals, ultimately affecting overall cellular behavior. Thus, the dynamics of extracellular fluid flow are integral to understanding how cells transition between quiescence and active proliferation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976619, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_9654a743ed", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
