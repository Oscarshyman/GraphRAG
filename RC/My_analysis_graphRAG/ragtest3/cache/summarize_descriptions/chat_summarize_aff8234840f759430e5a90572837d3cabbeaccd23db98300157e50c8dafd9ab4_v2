In this state, cells are primed for re-entry into the cell cycle, allowing them to quickly revert to proliferation upon receiving appropriate stimuli. This temporary dormancy contrasts with deeper states of quiescence, as cells in shallow quiescence are more likely to respond to growth signals and can readily transition back into active cell division. Overall, shallow quiescence represents a dynamic equilibrium where cells maintain a balance between dormancy and readiness for proliferation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976611, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 581, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
