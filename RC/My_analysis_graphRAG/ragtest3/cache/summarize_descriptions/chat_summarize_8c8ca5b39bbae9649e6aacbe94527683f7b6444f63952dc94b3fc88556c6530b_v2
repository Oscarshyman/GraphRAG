Lysosomal function plays a crucial role in modulating the depth of quiescence, suggesting that the activity of lysosomes is integral to the regulation of this state. As quiescence deepens, there is a notable increase in lysosomal gene expression, further underscoring the connection between lysosomal function and the quiescent state. Additionally, lysosome activation has been shown to enhance the activation of quiescent neural stem cells during the aging process, indicating that lysosomes not only influence quiescence but also play a significant role in the activation of stem cells as they transition out of this state. Overall, these findings highlight the intricate relationship between lysosomes and quiescence, particularly in the context of aging and stem cell biology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976617, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_9654a743ed", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
