Within this broader concept, SHALLOW QUIESCENCE is identified as a specific, less profound state of quiescence. It signifies a relationship between varying depths of quiescence, where shallow quiescence represents a less stable form of dormancy. This state allows cells to more readily re-enter the cell cycle upon stimulation, making it easier for them to transition back to active proliferation compared to deeper states of quiescence. Overall, shallow quiescence facilitates quicker re-entry into the cell cycle, highlighting its role in the dynamic regulation of cellular activity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743976618, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 378, "total_tokens": 513, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert biomedical researcher.
