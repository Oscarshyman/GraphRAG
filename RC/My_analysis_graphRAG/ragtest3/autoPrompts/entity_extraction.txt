-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [cell, biochemical cues, molecular markers, cell cycle, quiescence, senescence, aging, lysosome, extracellular flow, stem cells, gene expression, mechanotransduction, physiological phenomena, diseases, biomedical research]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

4aactivation occurs through epigenetic derepression in MuSCs [18]
but via p38 MAPK hyperactivation in HSPCs [14]. Blocking p16INK4aactivation prevents the
quiescence-to-senescence transition only in a subset of cells [13], suggesting the involvement
of other molecular effectors driving the quiescence-origin senescence. Furthermore, is
lysosomal autophagy always the primary trigger for quiescence deepening and transition
to senescence, and does this process always converge onto the Rb–E2F switch threshold—or
possibly regulate downstream switches controlling S phase entry [67,68] or downstream
E2F target genes necessary for cell proliferation [41,78]? Growing cells exiting from either
the G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle converge onto the same senescent state with a G1-like
molecular signature [76]. How about quiescence-origin senescence? What are its molecular
markers, and to what extent do they overlap with or differ from the markers of proliferation-
origin senescence, beyond the sustained (if not totally irreversible) arrested phenotype
(Figure 1)? Future investigations are needed to ﬁnd the answers.
4. Conclusions
Unlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence
involves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously
understudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of
cells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837
 6 of 8

is expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells
in our tissues than previously realized.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence
transition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of
biomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative
medicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms
of quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular
markers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked
senescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.

by comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can cor-

C
ell proliferation in multicellular organisms is tightly regu-

lated, and the vast majority of cells in the body stay dormant

and out of the cell cycle at any given moment. The dormant

state, when reversible upon growth signals, is referred to as

cellular quiescence. Quiescence protects cells against stress and
irreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many
physiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and

tissue repair (1

–
4). Consequently, dysregulation of cellular qui-

escence can lead to a range of hyper- and hypoproliferative
diseases, including cancer and aging (5

–
7).

It becomes increasingly recognized that quiescence is a het-

erogeneous state with graded depth. For example, following in-
jury, muscle and neural stem cells at noninjury sites in the body
move adaptively into shallower quiescence (alert or primed

quiescent phase), positioning cells to more quickly respond to

injury and reenter the cell cycle when needed (8, 9). In other
cases, cells move into deep quiescence and require stronger

growth stimulation and longer times to reenter the cell cycle, as

seen in hepatocytes upon partial hepatectomy in older rats than
in younger ones (10, 11). Similarly, the quiescent state deepens
in cells that are cultured longer under quiescence-inducing sig-

nals, such as contact inhibition (12, 13) and serum starvation
(14). Deep quiescent cells can still revert to proliferation under

physiological conditions, appearing distinct from irreversibly

arrested senescent cells (
