-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [cell, molecule, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, growth factor, experimental data, mechanical stress, gene, transcriptome]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

senescence, which aligns with the fact that mTOR activity is linked to shallow quiescence

different from proliferation-origin senescence from the aspect of mTOR and geroconversion

Figure 1.Quiescence-origin senescence. Conventional senescence originates from proliferating and
growing cells via mTOR-mediated geroconversion, when cell growth continues aberrantly after the
cell cycle is blocked in response to severe stress and damage. In comparison, quiescence-origin
senescence originates from quiescent cells via quiescence deepening, accompanied by a progressively
increasing Rb–E2F switch threshold in response to decreased lysosomal autophagy and increased ROS
accumulation and protein aggregation. Senescent cells are irreversibly arrested under physiological
conditions. Deep quiescent cells are reversible but require stronger growth stimulation and take a
longer time to re-enter the cell cycle than shallow quiescent cells. The boundary between very deep

reported (31). The continuously increased LysoTracker intensity

in deep quiescence was consistent with an increased number of

lysosomes, another indicator of lysosomal mass; for example,
