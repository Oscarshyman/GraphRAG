The Quiescence–Senescence Continuum: A Framework for Understanding\nQuiescence-Origin Senescence\n2.1. Direct Transition from Quiescence to Senescence\nMounting evidence in the past decade demonstrates a direct transition to senescence in\nquiescent cells under stress or with aging. One of the ﬁrst reports of this phenomenon was\nin geriatric mice, where quiescent satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MuSCs) lose regenerative\ncapacity and become irreversibly arrested [13]. The same observation was conﬁrmed in\ngeriatric human muscle, suggesting a conserved mechanism contributing to age-related\ndecline in muscle regenerative capacity [13]. The quiescence-to-senescence transition in\ngeriatric MuSCs was linked to the epigenetic derepression of p16INK4a, which is a key\nregulator of senescence [13].\nFurther research revealed that p16INK4aderepression in geriatric MuSCs was triggered\nby accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from failed autophagy [18]. Restor-\ning autophagy prevents the transition to senescence in quiescent MuSCs [18]. Similarly,\nin quiescent human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), stress-induced ROS\naccumulation can elevate the p16 INK4alevel and drive the transition to senescence [14].\nIn vitrostudies provide further evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence tran-\nsition. Long-term quiescent human ﬁbroblasts in culture (100–150 days) accumulate DNA\ndamage and transit into senescence [15]. Our recent work showed that quiescent rat\nembryonic ﬁbroblasts (REFs) with impaired lysosomal autophagy can directly enter a\nsenescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest,β-galactosidase activity,\nand cellular hypertrophy [16]. Thesein vitroresults strengthen the ﬁndings ofin vivo\nstudies by showing that cells maintained in quiescent conditions throughout the experi-\nments eventually transitioned to senescence, bypassing cell proliferation (which can be\ndifﬁcult to trackin vivo, e.g., throughout the entire geriatric phase). Together, thesein vivo\nandin vitrostudies provide compelling evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition, resulting in quiescence-origin senescence.\n2.2. Quiescence Deepening into Senescence: A Continuum Model\nThe observation that cells can transition from quiescence to senescence aligns with the\nconcept that quiescence is not a uniform state but rather a spectrum of dormant depths.\nSpeciﬁcally, deeper quiescent cells are more resistant to cell cycle re-entry, and they resume\nproliferation less frequently or with a longer delay than shallower quiescent cells given the\nsame growth stimulation [8,19–35]. Cells in deep quiescence generally exhibit decreased\ntranscription, reduced RNA and protein levels, and increased chromatin condensation\ncompared to cells in shallow quiescence [22,36–38]. Recent studies have further revealed the\nchanges in the cellular proﬁles of gene expression, epigenetic modiﬁcation, and metabolism\nthat occur during the process of quiescence deepening [8,16,39–41]. It is important to note\nthat deep quiescent cells, by deﬁnition, still retain the potential for cell cycle re-entry and\ncan resume proliferation given a sufﬁciently strong and sustained growth stimulus, which\nis distinct from senescent cells.\nQuiescence deepening has been observed under extended quiescence in culture or\nalong the aging processin vivoacross mammalian cell types and tissues [8,19–33] as wellBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 3 of 8\n\nas in yeast [34] and C. elegans [35]. Consistent with quiescence depth being a continuum,\nsubpopulations of quiescent muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, upon tissue\ninjury or in response to systemic factors, can move to shallower (primed or GAlert) qui-\nescence, bearing a closer resemblance to active cells [42–45]. Further extending the cell\ndormancy state continuum, senescent cells also exhibit varying “depths” with different\ncellular characteristics [46–48].\nOur recent work directly links quiescence deepening to senescence entry. We found\nthat while enhancing lysosomal autophagy activity pushes REFs toward shallow quiescence,\ndecreasing lysosomal autophagy drives REFs into progressively deeper quiescence [16].\nWhen lysosomal autophagy is severely hampered (with chloroquine treatment, for exam-\nple), deep quiescent (yet still reversible) cells transition into irreversible senescence [16].\nThis suggests that lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” that continu-\nously adjusts cellular dormancy depth from shallow quiescence to deep quiescence and\nﬁnally to senescence [16,41]. Furthermore, the transcriptomic proﬁle changes during qui-\nescence\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescent cells are cells that have lost the ability to divide and grow, often as a result of stress or aging, and are implicated in age-related diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL DORMANCY-STATE PLASTICITY<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Cell dormancy-state plasticity refers to the ability of cells to transition between different states of dormancy and senescence, influenced by various factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUESCENCE-TO-SENESCENCE TRANSITION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>The quiescence-to-senescence transition is a process where quiescent cells become senescent under stress or aging conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>CELL TYPE<|>Geriatric mice are older mice used in research to study age-related changes, including the behavior of muscle stem cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are a type of stem cell involved in muscle regeneration that can enter a quiescent state and transition to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>BIOMARKER<|>P16INK4A is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates the cell cycle and is a key factor in the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>BIOMARKER<|>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules that can cause cellular damage and are involved in the transition to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>MECHANISM<|>Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, playing a role in maintaining cellular health and preventing senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a specific type of autophagy that involves the lysosome and is crucial for cellular homeostasis and preventing senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Deep quiescence is a state of prolonged dormancy in which cells are less likely to re-enter the cell cycle and are more resistant to stimuli.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Shallow quiescence is a less stable state of dormancy where cells can more readily resume proliferation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHLOQUINE TREATMENT<|>INTERVENTION STRATEGY<|>Chloroquine treatment is an intervention that inhibits autophagy and can drive cells from deep quiescence into irreversible senescence.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>Geriatric mice are used to study the behavior of muscle stem cells, particularly their transition to senescence with aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUESCENCE-TO-SENESCENCE TRANSITION<|>P16INK4A<|>P16INK4A is a key regulator in the transition from quiescence to senescence in muscle stem cells.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>P16INK4A<|>Accumulated ROS can trigger the derepression of P16INK4A, leading to the transition to senescence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a specific mechanism of autophagy that is crucial for preventing the transition to senescence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>Deep quiescence and shallow quiescence represent different states of dormancy, with varying capacities for cell cycle re-entry.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHLOQUINE TREATMENT<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>Chloroquine treatment inhibits lysosomal autophagy, leading to a transition from deep quiescence to senescence.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
