In particular, we\n\nfound that lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass (in-\n\ndicated by the intensity of lysosomal staining and the number of\n\nlysosomes per cell) continuously increase as quiescence deepens;\n\nhowever, autophagy flux decreases. Lysosomes are hydrolytic\n\nenzyme-filled organelles in the cell that break down many types of\n\nbiomolecules; lysosomal function, primarily through processes of\n\nautophagy and endocytosis, has been shown to prevent irreversible\n\ncellular states, such as senescenc\ne, terminal differentiation, and\n\nSignificance\nReactivating sleep-like quiescent cells in the body (most nota-\n\nbly stem cells) to divide is fundamental to tissue homeostasis\n\nand regeneration. Like sleep having shallow and deep stages,\nquiescence exhibits graded depths with different speeds and\nrates responding to stimulation signals. Understanding how\n\nquiescence depth is regulated is fundamental to our under-\n\nstanding of tissue repair and regeneration. Here we show that\nquiescence depth is regulated like a\n\n“\ndimmer switch\n”\nby lyso-\n\nsomes (cell organelles that break down and recycle biomole-\n\ncules), through the lysosomal function of reducing oxidative\nstress. We developed a gene signature to predict quiescence\ndepth and show that quiescence deepening likely represents a\n\ntransition path from cell division to irreversibly arrested se-\n\nnescence, related to the aging process.\n\nAuthor contributions: K.F., R.L., J.X., F.B., and G.Y. designed research; K.F., R.L., H.C., and\n\nK.D.C. performed research; K.F., R.L., H.C., K.D.C., H.H.Z., J.X., F.B., and G.Y. analyzed\ndata; and K.F., F.B., and G.Y. wrote the paper.\n\nThe authors declare no competing interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\nPublished under the\nPNAS license.\n\nData deposition: The data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Gene Ex-\n\npression Omnibus (GEO) database,\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo(accession no.\n\nGSE124109\n).\n1K.F. and R.L. contributed equally to this work.\n2To whom correspondence may be addressed.

Here we found that the increased lysosomal mass\n\nin deep quiescent cells is, in part, due to decreased autophagy flux,\n\nwhich is partially but not fully compensated by increased lysosomal\n\ngene expression and lysosomal biogenesis. We show that lysosomal\nfunction, like a dimmer switch, cont\ninuously regulates quiescence\n\ndepth and thus the proliferative potential of quiescent cells by re-\n\nducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We\n\nfound that a set of\n\n“\nsenescence core signature\n”\ngenes (19) show\n\nsimilar expression patterns in deep quiescence as in senescence, and\nthat a gene-expression signature w\ne developed to indicate cellular\n\nquiescence depth by comparing deep and shallow quiescent REF\n\ncells is able to correctly classify senescent and aging cells in a wide\narray of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo (22, 23),\n\nsuggesting that deep quiescence may serve as a common transition\n\npath from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\n\nResults\nDynamic Transcriptome Changes during Quiescence Deepening.\nSimilar\n\nto our previous observation (14), REF cells moved into deeper\nquiescence progressively with longer-term serum starvation. After\n2-d serum starvation, the entire cell population entered quiescence, as\n\ndemonstrated by their negative D\nNA incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2\n′\n-\n\ndeoxyuridine (EdU) and a complete shut-off of E2f1 expression (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S1\n B\n). E2f1 is a member of the E2f family of tran-\n\nscription factors; it up-regulates a large battery of genes involved in\n\nDNA replication and cell cycle progression, acting as the key ef-\n\nfector of an Rb-E2f bistable switch that controls the all-or-none\ntransition from quiescence to proliferation (24, 25). With in-\n\ncreasingly longer serum starvati\non, cells moved into deeper quies-\n\ncence, requiring a longer time and a greater serum stimulation\nstrength (concentration) to reen\nter the cell cycle than cells in\n\nshallower quiescence. For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosomal gene expression refers to the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in the formation and function of lysosomes, which are organelles that degrade biomolecules.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL MASS<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosomal mass indicates the quantity of lysosomes within a cell, which can be assessed through staining techniques and is associated with cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY FLUX<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Autophagy flux is the process by which cellular components are degraded and recycled through autophagy, a critical mechanism for maintaining cellular homeostasis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest that allows cells to conserve energy and resources, often in response to environmental stressors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescence is a permanent state of cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to stress, leading to changes in cell function and phenotype.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERMINAL DIFFERENTIATION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Terminal differentiation is the process by which a cell becomes a specialized cell type and loses the ability to divide.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMES<|>CELL TYPE<|>Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles filled with hydrolytic enzymes that break down biomolecules and are involved in cellular waste disposal and recycling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OXIDATIVE STRESS<|>MECHANISM<|>Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of the body to neutralize them, leading to cellular damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENE SIGNATURE<|>BIOMARKER<|>A gene signature is a set of genes whose expression patterns can be used to predict specific biological states, such as quiescence depth or cellular senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL DIVISION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells, essential for growth and tissue repair.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>DISEASE PROCESS<|>Aging is the gradual decline in physiological function and regenerative capacity, often associated with increased cellular senescence and decreased tissue homeostasis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REF CELLS<|>CELL TYPE<|>REF cells are a type of fibroblast cell line used in research to study cellular processes such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PNAS<|>PUBLICATION<|>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) is a scientific journal that publishes research articles across various fields of science, including studies on cellular biology.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>LYSOSOMAL MASS<|>Increased lysosomal gene expression is associated with an increase in lysosomal mass as cells enter deeper quiescence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence is a reversible state that can transition into senescence if cells remain in a non-dividing state for too long.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY FLUX<|>LYSOSOMAL MASS<|>Decreased autophagy flux contributes to the accumulation of lysosomal mass in deep quiescent cells.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMES<|>OXIDATIVE STRESS<|>Lysosomes help reduce oxidative stress by degrading reactive oxygen species, thus regulating quiescence depth.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENE SIGNATURE<|>QUESCENCE<|>The gene signature developed can predict quiescence depth, indicating its role in classifying cellular states.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>SENESCENCE<|>Aging is associated with increased cellular senescence, which is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELL DIVISION<|>QUESCENCE<|>Cell division is inhibited during quiescence, highlighting the relationship between these two biological processes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>QUESCENCE<|>REF cells are used to study the dynamics of quiescence and its regulation in cellular biology.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PNAS<|>GENE SIGNATURE<|>The research on gene signatures predicting quiescence depth was published in PNAS, indicating its scientific significance.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
