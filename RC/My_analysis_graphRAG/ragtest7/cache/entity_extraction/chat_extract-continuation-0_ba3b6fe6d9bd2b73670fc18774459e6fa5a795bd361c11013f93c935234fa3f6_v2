To induce quiescence, cells were plated at\n\n∼\n50%\n\nconfluence in growth medium for a day, washed twice with DMEM, and\n\ncultured in serum-starvation medium (DMEM containing 0.02% BGS) for the\n\nindicated duration (\n\n≥\n2d).\n\n\nQuiescence-Depth Assay.\n\nTo assess quiescence depth, cells were switched from\n\nserum-starvation medium to serum-stimulation medium (DMEM containing\n\nBGS at indicated concentrations) and harvested at indicated time points by\n\ntrypsinization. The cell fraction that reentered the cell cycle was quantified by\n\nassessing the profile of EdU incorporation (and the profiles of E2f-GFP re-\n\nporter and PI DNA staining when indicated).
