Altogether, our study suggests that increased lyso-\n\nsomal mass (containing damaged lysosomes) is both partially\n\ncaused by and contributes to decreased lysosomal function and\nautophagic clearance in deep quiescence.\n\nInhibiting Lysosomal Function Deepens Cellular Quiescence.\nOur next\nquestion concerns whether the decreased lysosomal function is\n\ncausal to, or merely a consequence of, deep quiescence. If de-\n\ncreased lysosomal function causes deep quiescence, we expect\nthat inhibiting lysosomal function in quiescent cells would fur-\n\nther deepen quiescence and that increasing lysosomal function\n\nwould lead to shallow quiescence.\nTo test this idea, we first performed pharmacological in-\nhibition of lysosomal function and measured corresponding\nchanges in quiescence depth (Fig. 4\n\nA\n). As seen in Fig. 1\nA\nand\nB\n,\n\ndeep quiescent cells under longer-term serum starvation both\n\nrequire a higher serum concentration and take a longer time to\nreenter the cell cycle. This result is consistent with our earlier\n\nstudy with targeted perturbations (although the relative degree\nof required increases in serum concentration and time may vary\n\ndepending on the specific quiescence-deepening factors) (14).\n\nHere we used at least 1 consistent indicator, the minimum serum\n\nconcentration required for cell cycle reentry, to measure quies-\n\ncence depth throughout this study.\n\nWe applied 2 lysosomal inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and\n\nchloroquine (CQ), that prevent lysosomal acidification (36). A\nshort exposure (6 h) to either drug was sufficient to inhibit ly-\n\nsosomal function in REF cells, evident by the impaired pro-\n\nteolytic degradation within the lysosomal compartment (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n, Fig. S5\nA\n). When quiescent cells were treated with\n\neither of these 2 lysosomal inhibitors, increasingly higher serum\nconcentrations were required to activate cells to reenter the cell\n\ncycle, in a drug dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4\n\nB\n–\nD\n; red arrow\n\npoints to serum concentration for activating\n\n∼\n50% of cells, judged\n\nbased on EdU incorporation, E2f-GFP reporter, and propidium\n\niodide [PI] staining, respectively). Correspondingly, at a given\nserum concentration (e.g., 4% serum), a decreasing percentage of\n\ncells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU\n+\n)withanincreasing\n\ndose of either lysosomal inhibitor, Baf or CQ (Fig. 4\n\nB\n). The ly-\n\nsosomal inhibition-caused quiescence deepening occurred re-\n\ngardless of the preceding quiescence depth before drug treatment:\n\nAs shown in\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S5\n B\n, a higher serum concentration\n\nwas required to activate drug-treated (blue curve) than nontreated\n\n(red curve) cells at all test conditions (serum-starvation days).\n\nConsistently, cells took longer time to reenter the cell cycle\n\nunder the treatments of lysosomal inhibitors Baf and CQ. For\n\nexample, with either the treatment of 5\n\n/uni03BC\nM CQ or control\n\n(Dulbecco\n\n’\ns phosphate-buffered saline, DPBS), although nearly\n\nall cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU\n+\n) by the 24th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB\n\nC\nD\n\nFig. 3.\n\nLysosomal\n–\nautophagic function and lysosome destruction decline as\n\nquiescence deepens.
