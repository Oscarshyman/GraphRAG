Thus, here we tested whether lysosomal\n\nfunction potentially prevents quiescence deepening by anti-\n\noxidation. If it does, we reasoned that increasing antioxidation in\nthe cell would reduce quiescence depth. Indeed, we found that\nsupplementing antioxida\nnt 2-mercaptoethanol (\nβ\nME) drove\n\nquiescent cells into a shallower state, from which cells became\nmore sensitive to growth signals (higher EdU\n+\n% upon serum\nstimulation) (Fig. 6\n\nA\n); conversely, supplementing an oxidative\n\nreagent tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) drove cells into deeper\nquiescence, shown by the lower EdU\n+\n% (Fig. 6\n\nB\n) and lower E2f-\n\nON% (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S7\nA\n) upon stimulation at a given serum\n\nconcentration with increasing tBHP concentration.
