Cell morphologies werefound comparable across the/uniFB02ow rate range (0–20/uni03BCl/h)(Supplementary Figure S1A). To induce quiescence exit,following serum starvation, the microdevice was disconnectedfrom the/uniFB02ow-feeding setup (syringe and pump), and serum-stimulation medium (1–4% BGS in DMEM) was gently/uniFB02owedinto the micro-chamber using a pipette and a tip at the inlettubing of the device. The medium change step is fast (<1 min for140 µl medium) and identical to all quiescent cell groups,avoiding the bias in the exposure time of cells to thestimulation medium (if otherwise using slow/uniFB02ows at different/uniFB02ow rates, 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h). Cells were then incubated with serum-stimulation medium at static condition (again, identical to allquiescent cell groups). After 26 h of serum stimulation, cellsinside the channel were harvested, and the intensities of E2f-GFP signals from individual cells were measured using a/uniFB02owcytometer (BD LSR II). Flow cytometry data were analyzed usingFlowJo software (version 10.0).The percentage of cells with the E2f at the“On”state (E2f-On%) in a cell population after serum stimulation was used as anindex for quiescence depth before stimulation: the smaller theE2f-On%, the deeper the quiescence depth prior to serumstimulation (Kwon et al., 2017). Consistent with our previousstudies in static-medium experiments (Kwon et al., 2017;Wanget al., 2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019), E2f-On% was foundcomparable to the percentage of cells with EdU incorporation(EdU+%) in the micro/uniFB02uidic experiments under continuous/uniFB02ows (Supplementary Figures S1B,C). In the EdUincorporation assay, 1 µM EdU was added to the serum-stimulation medium at 0 h, and the EdU signal intensity wasmeasured 30 h after serum stimulation by the Click-iT EdU assayfollowing the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher, C10634).\nMathematical Modeling and StochasticSimulations\nTo account for the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on quiescencedepth, the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow-associated terms were added to the serumresponse terms in our previously established Rb-E2F bistableswitch model (Supplementary Table S1)(Yao et al., 2008). Basedon the resultant ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework(Supplementary Table S1), a Langevin-type stochasticdifferential equation (SDE) model was constructed as follows(Gillespie, 2000;Lee et al., 2010):X\ni(t+τ)/equalsXi(t)+/summationdisplayMj/equals1\n]jiaj[X(t)]τ+θ/summationdisplayMj/equals1\n]ji/parenleftBigaj[X(t)]τ/parenrightBig1/2γ+δωτ\n1/2\n(2)where the/uniFB01rst two terms on the right account for deterministickinetics, and the third and fourth terms represent intrinsic andextrinsic noise, respectively.X(t)/equals(X1(t),...,Xn(t))is thesystem state at timet.X\ni(t)is the molecule number of speciesi(i/equals1,...,n)at timet.
