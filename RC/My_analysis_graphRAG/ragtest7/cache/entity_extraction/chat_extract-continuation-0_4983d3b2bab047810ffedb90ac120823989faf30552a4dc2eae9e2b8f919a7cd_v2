The present study shows\n\nthat instead of a simple OFF\n\n–\nON switch, lysosomes function as a\n\ndimmer switch to continuously modulate quiescence depth (Fig.\n\n6\n\nH\n) and proliferative capacity of quiescent cells.\n\nOur study suggests that as cells move deeper in quiescence,\nlysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass increase, but ly-\n\nsosomal function and lysosome destruction decrease. Decreased\n\nlysosome destruction via autophagy/lysophagy contributes to an\nincreased lysosomal mass and likely an accumulation of damaged\nlysosomes, which in turn contributes to a decreased lysosomal\n\n–\n\n\nautophagy function. Decreased lysosome destruction alone,\n\nhowever, does not fully explain the increased lysosomal mass\n(both lysoTracker intensity of lysosome number) observed in\n\ndeep quiescent cells (Fig. 2\n\nG\nand\nH\n), as blocking lysosome\n\ndestruction increased LysoTracker intensity but not the number\nof lysosomes in REF cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4); similarly, it was\n\nreported previously that lysosomal number did not change or\n\neven mildly decreased in autophagy-impaired fibroblasts with\n\nAtg4B and Atg7 mutations (46). The other contributing factor of\nincreased lysosomal mass in deep quiescence appears to be ly-\nsosomal biogenesis: The expression of Mitf, a master regulator of\n\nlysosomal biogenesis, significantly increased the lysosomal\n\nnumber (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S6\nE\n) in quiescent REF cells. Con-\n\nsistently, we found that applying small chemical inhibitors to\nrepress Mcoln1 (also known as TRPML1) that is crucial for ly-\n\nsosome biogenesis (47) significantly decreased lysosomal number\n\nin quiescent REF cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S8\nA\nand\nB\n). The in-\n\ncrease in lysosome biogenesis itself is likely compensatory to\n\nquiescence deepening: Mitf expression increases significantly\n\nalong with quiescence deepening (Fig. 5\n\nA\n); relatedly, inhibiting\n\nlysosome biogenesis further deepens quiescence (lower EdU\n+\n%\nwith Mcoln1 inhibitors than with DMSO control) (\n\nSI Appendix\n,\n\nFig. S8\n\nC\n). The dynamic balance and relative contributions of\n\nlysosome biogenesis and degradation destruction in deep quies-\ncence await further investigation.\nREF cells in deep quiescence exhibited reduced autophagy\n\nflux (Fig. 3\n\nA\n), which may be relevant to the declined autophagy\n\nobserved in aging (15, 48\n\n–\n50) and senescent cells (17, 51).
