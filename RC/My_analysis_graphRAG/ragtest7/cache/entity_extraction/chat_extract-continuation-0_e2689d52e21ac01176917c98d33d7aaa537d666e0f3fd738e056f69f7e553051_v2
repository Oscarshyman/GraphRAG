M. Hogan, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, and approved October 1, 2019 (received for review September 16, 2019)\n\nThe reactivation of quiescent cells to proliferate is fundamental to\n\ntissue repair and homeostasis in the body. Often referred to as the\n\nG0 state, quiescence is, however, not a uniform state but with graded\ndepth. Shallow quiescent cells exhibit a higher tendency to revert to\nproliferation than deep quiescent cells, while deep quiescent cells\n\nare still fully reversible under physiological conditions, distinct from\n\nsenescent cells. Cellular mechani\nsms underlying the control of quies-\n\ncence depth and the connection between quiescence and senescence\n\nare poorly characterized, representing a missing link in our under-\n\nstanding of tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Here we measured\ntranscriptome changes as rat embryonic fibroblasts moved from\nshallow to deep quiescence over time in the absence of growth\n\nsignals. We found that lysosomal gene expression was significantly\n\nup-regulated in deep quiescence, an\nd partially compensated for grad-\n\nually reduced autophagy flux. Reduc\ning lysosomal function drove\n\ncells progressively deeper into qui\nescence and eventually into a\n\nsenescence-like irreversibly arrested state; increasing lysosomal func-\n\ntion, by lowering oxidative stress\n, progressively pushed cells into\n\nshallower quiescence. That is, lys\nosomal function modulates graded\n\nquiescence depth betwe\nen proliferation and senescence as a dimmer\n\nswitch. Finally, we found that a gene-\nexpression signature developed\n\nby comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can cor-\nrectly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro\n\nand in vivo, suggesting that while qui\nescence is generally considered\n\nto protect cells from irreversible a\nrrest of senescence, quiescence\n\ndeepening likely represents a common transition path from cell pro-\nliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\nquiescence\n|\ndormancy\n|\nsenescence\n|\naging\n|\nlysosome\n\nC\nell proliferation in multicellular organisms is tightly regu-\n\nlated, and the vast majority of cells in the body stay dormant\n\nand out of the cell cycle at any given moment. The dormant\n\nstate, when reversible upon growth signals, is referred to as\n\ncellular quiescence. Quiescence protects cells against stress and\nirreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many\nphysiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and\n\ntissue repair (1\n\n–\n4). Consequently, dysregulation of cellular qui-\n\nescence can lead to a range of hyper- and hypoproliferative\ndiseases, including cancer and aging (5\n\n–\n7).\n\nIt becomes increasingly recognized that quiescence is a het-\n\nerogeneous state with graded depth. For example, following in-\njury, muscle and neural stem cells at noninjury sites in the body\nmove adaptively into shallower quiescence (alert or primed\n\nquiescent phase), positioning cells to more quickly respond to\n\ninjury and reenter the cell cycle when needed (8, 9). In other\ncases, cells move into deep quiescence and require stronger\n\ngrowth stimulation and longer times to reenter the cell cycle, as\n\nseen in hepatocytes upon partial hepatectomy in older rats than\nin younger ones (10, 11). Similarly, the quiescent state deepens\nin cells that are cultured longer under quiescence-inducing sig-\n\nnals, such as contact inhibition (12, 13) and serum starvation\n(14). Deep quiescent cells can still revert to proliferation under\n\nphysiological conditions, appearing distinct from irreversibly\n\narrested senescent cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S1\nA\n). A graded qui-\n\nescence depth indicates graded potentials for tissue repair and\n\nregeneration; yet, how quiescence depth is regulated in the cell\n\nand the connection between deep quiescence and senescence are\n\nnot well understood.\n\nIn this study, we investigate what regulates quiescence depth in\n\nrat embryonic fibroblast (REF) cells. We identified sequential\n\ntranscriptome changes as cells move progressively deeper into\n\nquiescence under longer-term serum starvation. In particular, we\n\nfound that lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass (in-\n\ndicated by the intensity of lysosomal staining and the number of\n\nlysosomes per cell) continuously increase as quiescence deepens;\n\nhowever, autophagy flux decreases. Lysosomes are hydrolytic\n\nenzyme-filled organelles in the cell that break down many types of\n\nbiomolecules\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KOTARO FUJIMAKI<|>PERSON<|>Kotaro Fujimaki is a researcher involved in the study of cellular quiescence and its regulation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUOYAN LI<|>PERSON<|>Ruoyan Li is a co-author of the research on graded regulation of cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HENGYU CHEN<|>PERSON<|>Hengyu Chen is a researcher contributing to the study of cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIMIKO DELLA CROCE<|>PERSON<|>Kimiko Della Croce is a co-author involved in the research on cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAO HELEN ZHANG<|>PERSON<|>Hao Helen Zhang is a researcher contributing to the study of cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIANHUA XING<|>PERSON<|>Jianhua Xing is a co-author of the research on cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUANG YAO<|>PERSON<|>Guang Yao is a researcher involved in the study of cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Cellular quiescence is a reversible state of cell cycle arrest that allows cells to conserve energy and resources, crucial for tissue repair and homeostasis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to stressors, leading to aging and loss of tissue function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal function involves the activity of lysosomes, which are organelles that degrade biomolecules and are implicated in regulating cellular quiescence depth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Deep quiescence refers to a state of prolonged cell cycle arrest that requires stronger stimuli for re-entry into the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Shallow quiescence is a less stable state of cell cycle arrest that allows for quicker re-entry into proliferation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAT EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS<|>CELL TYPE<|>Rat embryonic fibroblasts are a type of cell used in research to study cellular quiescence and its regulation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>DISEASE PROCESS<|>Aging is a biological process characterized by the gradual decline in cellular function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KOTARO FUJIMAKI<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Kotaro Fujimaki is a lead researcher studying the mechanisms regulating cellular quiescence depth.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUOYAN LI<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Ruoyan Li is a co-author of the study investigating cellular quiescence and its regulation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENGYU CHEN<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Hengyu Chen contributed to the research on the regulation of cellular quiescence depth.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIMIKO DELLA CROCE<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Kimiko Della Croce is a co-author involved in the study of cellular quiescence regulation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAO HELEN ZHANG<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Hao Helen Zhang is a co-author of the research on cellular quiescence and its mechanisms.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JIANHUA XING<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Jianhua Xing is a co-author of the study investigating cellular quiescence depth regulation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUANG YAO<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Guang Yao is a researcher involved in the study of cellular quiescence and its implications.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal function is crucial in modulating the depth of cellular quiescence, influencing cell behavior.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEEP QUIESCENCE<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Deep quiescence is a specific state within the broader concept of cellular quiescence, indicating a more stable arrest.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHALLOW QUIESCENCE<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Shallow quiescence represents a less stable form of cellular quiescence, allowing quicker re-entry into the cell cycle.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>SENESCENCE<|>Aging is associated with the onset of senescence, marking a transition from quiescence to irreversible cell cycle arrest.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAT EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS<|>CELLULAR QUIESCENCE<|>Rat embryonic fibroblasts are used to study the mechanisms and regulation of cellular quiescence.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
