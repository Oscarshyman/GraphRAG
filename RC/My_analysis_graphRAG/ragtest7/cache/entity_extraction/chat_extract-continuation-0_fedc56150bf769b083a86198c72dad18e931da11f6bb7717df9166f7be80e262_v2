As showninFigures 4A,B, E2f-On% increased with increasing dextranconcentration in the serum-starvation medium under either 5 or20/uni03BCl/h/uniFB02ow rate. By contrast, cells cultured in static serum-starvation medium containing the same higher dextranconcentration entered deeper rather than shallower quiescence(Supplementary Figure S2; see Discussion). These results suggestthat the dextran-induced shallow quiescence in the presence ofextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow was primarily due to the viscosity-dependent shear stress (instead of other dextran-associatedeffects such as being a metabolic source). The higher dextranconcentration, thus higher viscosity, of the medium/uniFB02owgenerates higher shear stress under a continuous/uniFB02ow rate (5or 20/uni03BCl/h, seeTable 1; but not static 0/uni03BCl/h). Put together, ourresults showed that increasing only the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow shear stress,while keeping the same/uniFB02ow rate and pace of extracellular factorreplacement, leads to shallower quiescence.\nExtracellular Factor Replacement DrivesShallow Quiescence\nThe effect of continuous extracellular factor replacement oncellular quiescence depth was examined next.

Cells were then stimulated with serum at theindicated concentrations for 26 h, and the E2f-GFP signals were measured using/uniFB02ow cytometry.(A)The E2f-GFP histograms.

To assess the net effect ofextracellular factor replacement, while decoupling it from theeffect of mechanical shear stress, we set up two testcon/uniFB01gurations. In the/uniFB01rst“recycled-medium”con/uniFB01guration, atotal/uniFB02uid volume of eitherV= 120 or 480/uni03BCl oscillated back-and-forth through the microchannel at a constant/uniFB02ow rate of eitherQ= 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h, respectively. Thus, when the/uniFB02ow direction wasswitched every 24 h, the complete/uniFB02uid volumeVpassed throughthe microchannel once. In the second“fresh-medium”con/uniFB01guration, the/uniFB02uid oscillated exactly as in the/uniFB01rstcon/uniFB01guration, but fresh medium of volumeVwas supplied toreplace previous medium at each/uniFB02ow direction switch. In boththe recycled-medium and fresh-medium experiments, cells wereserum-starved for 4 days at a given/uniFB02ow rateQ(5 or 20/uni03BCl/h) andsubsequently stimulated with serum (1 and 2%, respectively)for 26 h.The quiescence depth measurements are shown inFigure 5.The fractions of cells exiting quiescence and reentering cell cycle(E2f-On%) were signi/uniFB01cantly higher in‘fresh-medium’than in“recycled-medium”at a given serum stimulation condition.These results were obtained at the same/uniFB02ow rate (either 5 or20/uni03BCl/h) and thus under the same mechanical shear stress. Thedifference that the cells experienced was medium replacement:once per 24 h during the 4-days serum-starvation in the fresh-medium con/uniFB01guration, whereas no medium replacement duringthe same period in the recycled-medium con/uniFB01guration. Theseresults suggest that with the/uniFB02ow rate and shear stress being equal,extracellular factor replacement alone (as in“fresh-medium”)induces shallower quiescence than without such a replacement(as in“\nrecycled-medium”).\nA Dynamic Model of Extracellular Fluid FlowRegulating Quiescence Depth\nWe next sought to develop a mathematical model to gainpotential mechanistic insight into the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on cellular quiescence depth.
