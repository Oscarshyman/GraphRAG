Instead, we found that autophagy\nflux, an indicator for the primary lysosomal function, did not in-\n\ncrease but gradually declined as cells moved deeper into quiescence,\n\nas seen in an LC3-II turnover assay (32) (Fig. 3\n\nA\n). This result posed\n\n2 immediate questions: 1) What is the relationship between in-\n\ncreased lysosomal mass and gene expression to decreased lysosomal\n\nfunction? 2) Does declined lysosomal function cause quiescence\ndeepening and, if so, how?\nAn increase of lysosomal mass can be caused by an increase of\nlysosome biogenesis or a decrease of lysosome destruction or\n\nboth. Since lysosome itself is destructed via an autophagic pro-\n\ncess named lysophagy (33, 34), the declined autophagy flux we\nobserved in cells with prolonged serum starvation (Fig. 3\n\nA\n)\n\nsuggests that the rate of lysosome destruction likely declines\n\naccordingly in deep quiescence. If this is the case, when we in-\nhibit autophagy/losophagy, we expect that 1) lysosomal mass will\n\nincrease in cells, and 2) the degree of increase (fold-change) will\n\nbe smaller in deep than shallow quiescent cells. Indeed, when we\ntreated 2-, 5-, and 8-d serum-starved quiescent cells with an\n\nautophagy inhibitor (nocodazole or vinblastine) (35) to repress\n\nautophagy/lysophagy (as seen by decreased autophagy flux in\nLC3 turnover assay) (Fig. 3\n\nB\n), we found that the relative in-\n\ncrease of LysoTracker intensity was smaller in cells under pro-\n\nlonged starvation (Fig. 3\n\nC\nand\nD\n). Although the result should be\n\ntaken with caveat since nocodazole and vinblastine are general\nautophagy inhibitors but not specific lysophagy inhibitors (which\n\nare lacking in the field to the best of our knowledge), and thus\n\nmay cause other side effects, this result, together with decreased\nautophagy (Fig. 3\n\nA\n), suggested that lysosome destruction de-\n\ncreased as quiescence deepened. Insufficient lysosome destruc-\n\ntion by autophagy/lysophagy can lead to an accumulation of\ndamaged lysosomes in the cell, which in turn interferes with ly-\n\nsosomal homeostasis and function (34).\n\nInterestingly, while blocking autophagy/lysophagy by either\n\nnocodazole or vinblastine increased the LysoTracker intensity in\n\nquiescent REF cells, it did not increase the number of lysosomes\n(\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4\nA\nand\nC\n) and even decreased the lysosomal\n\nnumber over time (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4\nB\nand\nD\n). This result is\n\ndifferent from the increased lysosomal number we observed,\nalong with quiescence deepening (Fig. 2\n\nH\n); it suggests that de-\n\ncreased lysosome destruction was not the only factor contribut-\n\ning to the increase of lysosomal mass in deep quiescent cells.\nIndeed, increased lysosome biogenesis (consistent with the in-\n\ncreased lysosomal gene expression, as seen in Fig. 2\n\nE\nand\nF\n) also\n\nplayed a role in this process, as we will explain further in the\n\nDiscussion\n\n. Altogether, our study suggests that increased lyso-\n\nsomal mass (containing damaged lysosomes) is both partially\n\ncaused by and contributes to decreased lysosomal function and\nautophagic clearance in deep quiescence.\n\nInhibiting L\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosomal function refers to the role of lysosomes in cellular processes, including degradation and recycling of cellular components.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosome destruction is a process that involves the breakdown of lysosomes, which can occur through autophagy or lysophagy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are metabolically inactive but can re-enter the cell cycle under favorable conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>MECHANISM<|>Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that degrades and recycles cellular components, including damaged organelles and proteins.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOPHAGY<|>MECHANISM<|>Lysophagy is a specific type of autophagy that targets lysosomes for degradation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOCODAZOLE<|>INTERVENTION STRATEGY<|>Nocodazole is a drug used to inhibit autophagy and disrupt microtubule function, affecting cellular processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINBLASTINE<|>INTERVENTION STRATEGY<|>Vinblastine is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits autophagy and affects cell division by disrupting microtubules.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal function decreases as quiescence deepens, indicating a relationship between cellular dormancy and lysosomal activity.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosome destruction decreases as quiescence deepens, suggesting that quiescent cells have impaired lysosomal degradation processes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>Autophagy is involved in lysosome destruction, and its inhibition leads to decreased lysosomal function and increased lysosomal mass.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOPHAGY<|>LYSOSOME DESTRUCTION<|>Lysophagy is a mechanism that contributes to lysosome destruction, and its decline affects lysosomal function in quiescent cells.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOCODAZOLE<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Nocodazole inhibits autophagy, affecting lysosomal function and the degradation of cellular components.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VINBLASTINE<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>Vinblastine inhibits autophagy, impacting lysosomal function and cellular processes related to quiescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
