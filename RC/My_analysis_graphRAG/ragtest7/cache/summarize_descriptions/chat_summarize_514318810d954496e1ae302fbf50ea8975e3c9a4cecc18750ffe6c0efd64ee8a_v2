It involves the movement of fluid outside cells, particularly through the extracellular matrix, and plays a vital role in providing both physical and biochemical cues to cells. This flow affects cellular behavior, including the depth of quiescence, by exerting shear stress and facilitating nutrient transport. Overall, extracellular fluid flow serves as a mechanical stimulus that shapes cellular characteristics and activities, highlighting its importance in the regulation of cellular functions within the biomedical context.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981110, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 444, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
