In this condition, cells exhibit reduced metabolic activity, which enables them to conserve energy while remaining poised to respond to external stimuli and environmental signals. This state is marked by a less stable form of cell cycle arrest, allowing cells to more readily re-enter the cell cycle and resume proliferation upon stimulation. Overall, shallow quiescence facilitates a quicker transition back to active cell division, making it a crucial phase for cellular adaptability and response to changing conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981104, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 455, "total_tokens": 574, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
