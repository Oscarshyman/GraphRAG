In the context of REF/E23 cells, serum starvation serves as a crucial intervention strategy that effectively induces this quiescent state. This process is significant for researchers studying cellular behavior and the mechanisms underlying quiescence, as it allows for the examination of cellular responses in a controlled environment. Thus, serum starvation is recognized as a key method for promoting cellular quiescence in REF/E23 cells.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981117, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
