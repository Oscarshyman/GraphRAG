They possess the unique ability to enter a quiescent state, which is a temporary period of inactivity that allows them to conserve energy and resources. This quiescent state is shallow, enabling MuSCs to quickly reenter the cell cycle in response to muscle injury. Additionally, muscle stem cells exhibit distinct responses to various signaling pathways, which further influences their function and regenerative capabilities. Overall, MuSCs are essential for maintaining muscle health and facilitating repair processes following damage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981104, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 440, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
