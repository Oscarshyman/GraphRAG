This process involves the addition of serum, which contains essential growth factors and nutrients, to cells that have been in a dormant state. By providing these growth factors, serum stimulation effectively reactivates quiescent cells, encouraging them to exit quiescence and initiate cell growth and division. Overall, serum stimulation serves as a crucial technique in cell biology for studying cell cycle dynamics and the mechanisms underlying cellular activation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981108, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 428, "total_tokens": 538, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
