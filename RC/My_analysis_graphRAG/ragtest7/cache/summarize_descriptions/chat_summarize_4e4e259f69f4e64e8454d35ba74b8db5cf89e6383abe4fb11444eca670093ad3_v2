In this state, cells experience prolonged cell cycle arrest, making them less likely to re-enter the cell cycle and requiring stronger stimuli to do so. This condition reflects a deeper level of dormancy compared to standard quiescence, where cells exhibit heightened resistance to growth signals and other activating factors. Overall, deep quiescence represents a critical phase in cellular regulation, emphasizing the importance of understanding its mechanisms for insights into cellular behavior and potential therapeutic applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981104, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 370, "total_tokens": 484, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
