These cells are instrumental in studying the dynamics of quiescence, where they can enter a deep quiescent state characterized by reduced autophagy flux. Researchers employ REF cells to explore the relationships between quiescence and cellular senescence, as well as to examine cellular responses to conditions such as nutrient starvation and lysosomal inhibition. Additionally, REF cells are valuable for studying lysosomal function and dynamics, making them a versatile tool in the exploration of fundamental cellular mechanisms.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981107, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 457, "total_tokens": 587, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
