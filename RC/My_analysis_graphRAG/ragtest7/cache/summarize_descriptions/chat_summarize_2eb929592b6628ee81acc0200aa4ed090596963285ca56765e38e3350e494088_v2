It is involved in cellular senescence, which is the process by which cells cease to divide and enter a state of permanent growth arrest. Additionally, RB is essential in managing the transition between quiescence, a state of dormancy, and proliferation, where cells actively divide. Through these functions, RB contributes to maintaining cellular integrity and preventing uncontrolled cell growth, which is a hallmark of cancer.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981106, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 98, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
