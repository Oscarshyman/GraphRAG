Yao, also known as Guang Yao, is a prominent researcher focused on the intricate mechanisms of cellular quiescence and the regulation of the cell cycle. His work encompasses multiple studies that delve into the dynamics of cellular states, particularly the bistable Rb-E2F switch, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. Yao has also contributed to the understanding of the origin of bistability in mammalian cell cycle entry, highlighting the complexities involved in cellular transitions. Additionally, he has worked with the E2f-GFP reporter, utilizing it as a tool to investigate cellular quiescence further. His scholarly contributions include an opinion paper discussing quiescence-origin senescence and its implications for cellular aging, underscoring his commitment to advancing knowledge in the field of biomedicine.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981104, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 376, "total_tokens": 539, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
