REF cells serve as a crucial model for investigating the mechanisms of quiescence, which is a state of cellular dormancy characterized by a lack of proliferation. These cells are employed to explore the dynamics of quiescence and its regulatory pathways, providing insights into how cells transition into and out of this state. Additionally, REF cells are instrumental in examining the quiescence-depth gene signature, which has significant implications for understanding various cellular states and their biological functions. Through these studies, researchers can better comprehend the role of quiescence in cellular behavior and its impact on health and disease.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981117, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
