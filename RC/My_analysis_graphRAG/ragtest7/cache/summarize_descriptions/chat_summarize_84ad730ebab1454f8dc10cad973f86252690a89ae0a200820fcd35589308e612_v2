This state of irreversible growth arrest leads to significant changes in cell function, phenotype, and morphology, ultimately contributing to aging and the loss of tissue function. Senescence is often triggered by stress signals and is associated with a stable cell cycle arrest, which prevents damaged cells from proliferating. As a result, senescence plays a crucial role in the aging process and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, highlighting its importance in both health and disease.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743981107, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
