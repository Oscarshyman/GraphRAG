Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

Cell morphologies werefound comparable across the/uniFB02ow rate range (0–20/uni03BCl/h)(Supplementary Figure S1A). To induce quiescence exit,following serum starvation, the microdevice was disconnectedfrom the/uniFB02ow-feeding setup (syringe and pump), and serum-stimulation medium (1–4% BGS in DMEM) was gently/uniFB02owedinto the micro-chamber using a pipette and a tip at the inlettubing of the device. The medium change step is fast (<1 min for140 µl medium) and identical to all quiescent cell groups,avoiding the bias in the exposure time of cells to thestimulation medium (if otherwise using slow/uniFB02ows at different/uniFB02ow rates, 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h). Cells were then incubated with serum-stimulation medium at static condition (again, identical to allquiescent cell groups). After 26 h of serum stimulation, cellsinside the channel were harvested, and the intensities of E2f-GFP signals from individual cells were measured using a/uniFB02owcytometer (BD LSR II). Flow cytometry data were analyzed usingFlowJo software (version 10.0).The percentage of cells with the E2f at the“On”state (E2f-On%) in a cell population after serum stimulation was used as anindex for quiescence depth before stimulation: the smaller theE2f-On%, the deeper the quiescence depth prior to serumstimulation (Kwon et al., 2017). Consistent with our previousstudies in static-medium experiments (Kwon et al., 2017;Wanget al., 2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019), E2f-On% was foundcomparable to the percentage of cells with EdU incorporation(EdU+%) in the micro/uniFB02uidic experiments under continuous/uniFB02ows (Supplementary Figures S1B,C). In the EdUincorporation assay, 1 µM EdU was added to the serum-stimulation medium at 0 h, and the EdU signal intensity wasmeasured 30 h after serum stimulation by the Click-iT EdU assayfollowing the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher, C10634).\nMathematical Modeling and StochasticSimulations\nTo account for the effects of extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow on quiescencedepth, the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow-associated terms were added to the serumresponse terms in our previously established Rb-E2F bistableswitch model (Supplementary Table S1)(Yao et al., 2008). Basedon the resultant ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework(Supplementary Table S1), a Langevin-type stochasticdifferential equation (SDE) model was constructed as follows(Gillespie, 2000;Lee et al., 2010):X\ni(t+τ)/equalsXi(t)+/summationdisplayMj/equals1\n]jiaj[X(t)]τ+θ/summationdisplayMj/equals1\n]ji/parenleftBigaj[X(t)]τ/parenrightBig1/2γ+δωτ\n1/2\n(2)where the/uniFB01rst two terms on the right account for deterministickinetics, and the third and fourth terms represent intrinsic andextrinsic noise, respectively.X(t)/equals(X1(t),...,Xn(t))is thesystem state at timet.X\ni(t)is the molecule number of speciesi(i/equals1,...,n)at timet.
