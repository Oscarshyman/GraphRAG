Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

The Quiescence–Senescence Continuum: A Framework for Understanding\nQuiescence-Origin Senescence\n2.1. Direct Transition from Quiescence to Senescence\nMounting evidence in the past decade demonstrates a direct transition to senescence in\nquiescent cells under stress or with aging. One of the ﬁrst reports of this phenomenon was\nin geriatric mice, where quiescent satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MuSCs) lose regenerative\ncapacity and become irreversibly arrested [13]. The same observation was conﬁrmed in\ngeriatric human muscle, suggesting a conserved mechanism contributing to age-related\ndecline in muscle regenerative capacity [13]. The quiescence-to-senescence transition in\ngeriatric MuSCs was linked to the epigenetic derepression of p16INK4a, which is a key\nregulator of senescence [13].\nFurther research revealed that p16INK4aderepression in geriatric MuSCs was triggered\nby accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from failed autophagy [18]. Restor-\ning autophagy prevents the transition to senescence in quiescent MuSCs [18]. Similarly,\nin quiescent human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), stress-induced ROS\naccumulation can elevate the p16 INK4alevel and drive the transition to senescence [14].\nIn vitrostudies provide further evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence tran-\nsition. Long-term quiescent human ﬁbroblasts in culture (100–150 days) accumulate DNA\ndamage and transit into senescence [15]. Our recent work showed that quiescent rat\nembryonic ﬁbroblasts (REFs) with impaired lysosomal autophagy can directly enter a\nsenescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest,β-galactosidase activity,\nand cellular hypertrophy [16]. Thesein vitroresults strengthen the ﬁndings ofin vivo\nstudies by showing that cells maintained in quiescent conditions throughout the experi-\nments eventually transitioned to senescence, bypassing cell proliferation (which can be\ndifﬁcult to trackin vivo, e.g., throughout the entire geriatric phase). Together, thesein vivo\nandin vitrostudies provide compelling evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition, resulting in quiescence-origin senescence.\n2.2. Quiescence Deepening into Senescence: A Continuum Model\nThe observation that cells can transition from quiescence to senescence aligns with the\nconcept that quiescence is not a uniform state but rather a spectrum of dormant depths.\nSpeciﬁcally, deeper quiescent cells are more resistant to cell cycle re-entry, and they resume\nproliferation less frequently or with a longer delay than shallower quiescent cells given the\nsame growth stimulation [8,19–35]. Cells in deep quiescence generally exhibit decreased\ntranscription, reduced RNA and protein levels, and increased chromatin condensation\ncompared to cells in shallow quiescence [22,36–38]. Recent studies have further revealed the\nchanges in the cellular proﬁles of gene expression, epigenetic modiﬁcation, and metabolism\nthat occur during the process of quiescence deepening [8,16,39–41]. It is important to note\nthat deep quiescent cells, by deﬁnition, still retain the potential for cell cycle re-entry and\ncan resume proliferation given a sufﬁciently strong and sustained growth stimulus, which\nis distinct from senescent cells.\nQuiescence deepening has been observed under extended quiescence in culture or\nalong the aging processin vivoacross mammalian cell types and tissues [8,19–33] as wellBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 3 of 8\n\nas in yeast [34] and C. elegans [35]. Consistent with quiescence depth being a continuum,\nsubpopulations of quiescent muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, upon tissue\ninjury or in response to systemic factors, can move to shallower (primed or GAlert) qui-\nescence, bearing a closer resemblance to active cells [42–45]. Further extending the cell\ndormancy state continuum, senescent cells also exhibit varying “depths” with different\ncellular characteristics [46–48].\nOur recent work directly links quiescence deepening to senescence entry. We found\nthat while enhancing lysosomal autophagy activity pushes REFs toward shallow quiescence,\ndecreasing lysosomal autophagy drives REFs into progressively deeper quiescence [16].\nWhen lysosomal autophagy is severely hampered (with chloroquine treatment, for exam-\nple), deep quiescent (yet still reversible) cells transition into irreversible senescence [16].\nThis suggests that lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” that continu-\nously adjusts cellular dormancy depth from shallow quiescence to deep quiescence and\nﬁnally to senescence [16,41]. Furthermore, the transcriptomic proﬁle changes during qui-\nescence\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>CELL<|>Senescent cells are cells that have entered a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, often as a result of stress or aging, and are characterized by distinct phenotypic changes and secretory profiles.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy where cells are metabolically inactive and do not proliferate, which can transition to senescence under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUESCENCE-ORIGIN SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence-origin senescence refers to the process where quiescent cells directly transition to a senescent state, particularly under stress or aging conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>CELL<|>Geriatric mice are older mice used in research to study age-related biological processes, including the behavior of quiescent satellite cells and their transition to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS<|>CELL<|>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are a type of stem cell found in muscle tissue that can enter quiescence and are involved in muscle regeneration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>P16INK4A<|>GENE<|>P16INK4A is a gene that encodes a protein that regulates the cell cycle and is a key factor in the transition from quiescence to senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES<|>MOLECULE<|>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen that can cause cellular damage and are implicated in the aging process and cellular stress responses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>MECHANISM<|>Autophagy is a cellular degradation process that recycles cellular components and is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>MECHANISM<|>Lysosomal autophagy is a specific type of autophagy that involves the degradation of cellular components within lysosomes, playing a role in cellular health and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS<|>CELL<|>Human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) are stem cells that give rise to all blood cells and can enter quiescence and transition to senescence under stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNA DAMAGE<|>MECHANISM<|>DNA damage refers to the physical damage to the DNA molecule, which can lead to cellular senescence if not properly repaired.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL CYCLE ARREST<|>MECHANISM<|>Cell cycle arrest is a mechanism that halts the progression of the cell cycle, often leading to senescence in response to stress or damage.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>Quiescent cells can transition to senescent cells under stress or aging, indicating a direct relationship between these two states.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERIATRIC MICE<|>MUSCLE STEM CELLS<|>Research in geriatric mice has shown that quiescent muscle stem cells lose regenerative capacity and become senescent, linking these two entities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>P16INK4A<|>QUIESCENCE-ORIGIN SENESCENCE<|>The derepression of P16INK4A in quiescent cells is a key regulator that triggers their transition to senescence, establishing a direct relationship.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES<|>P16INK4A<|>Accumulated reactive oxygen species can trigger the derepression of P16INK4A, linking oxidative stress to the transition from quiescence to senescence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>Impaired autophagy can lead to the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a critical relationship between these processes.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal autophagy activity influences the depth of quiescence, suggesting a relationship between autophagy and cellular dormancy states.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM PROGENITOR CELLS<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>Stress-induced ROS accumulation in HSPCs can elevate P16INK4A levels, driving their transition to senescence, linking these two entities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DNA DAMAGE<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>Accumulation of DNA damage in quiescent cells can lead to their transition into senescence, establishing a direct relationship.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELL CYCLE ARREST<|>SENESCENT CELLS<|>Cell cycle arrest is a characteristic feature of senescent cells, indicating a strong relationship between these two mechanisms.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
