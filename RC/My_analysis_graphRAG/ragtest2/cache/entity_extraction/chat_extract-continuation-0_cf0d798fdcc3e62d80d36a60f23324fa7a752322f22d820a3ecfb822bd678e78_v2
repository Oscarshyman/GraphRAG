Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

The present study shows\n\nthat instead of a simple OFF\n\n–\nON switch, lysosomes function as a\n\ndimmer switch to continuously modulate quiescence depth (Fig.\n\n6\n\nH\n) and proliferative capacity of quiescent cells.\n\nOur study suggests that as cells move deeper in quiescence,\nlysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass increase, but ly-\n\nsosomal function and lysosome destruction decrease. Decreased\n\nlysosome destruction via autophagy/lysophagy contributes to an\nincreased lysosomal mass and likely an accumulation of damaged\nlysosomes, which in turn contributes to a decreased lysosomal\n\n–\n\n\nautophagy function. Decreased lysosome destruction alone,\n\nhowever, does not fully explain the increased lysosomal mass\n(both lysoTracker intensity of lysosome number) observed in\n\ndeep quiescent cells (Fig. 2\n\nG\nand\nH\n), as blocking lysosome\n\ndestruction increased LysoTracker intensity but not the number\nof lysosomes in REF cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S4); similarly, it was\n\nreported previously that lysosomal number did not change or\n\neven mildly decreased in autophagy-impaired fibroblasts with\n\nAtg4B and Atg7 mutations (46). The other contributing factor of\nincreased lysosomal mass in deep quiescence appears to be ly-\nsosomal biogenesis: The expression of Mitf, a master regulator of\n\nlysosomal biogenesis, significantly increased the lysosomal\n\nnumber (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S6\nE\n) in quiescent REF cells. Con-\n\nsistently, we found that applying small chemical inhibitors to\nrepress Mcoln1 (also known as TRPML1) that is crucial for ly-\n\nsosome biogenesis (47) significantly decreased lysosomal number\n\nin quiescent REF cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S8\nA\nand\nB\n). The in-\n\ncrease in lysosome biogenesis itself is likely compensatory to\n\nquiescence deepening: Mitf expression increases significantly\n\nalong with quiescence deepening (Fig. 5\n\nA\n); relatedly, inhibiting\n\nlysosome biogenesis further deepens quiescence (lower EdU\n+\n%\nwith Mcoln1 inhibitors than with DMSO control) (\n\nSI Appendix\n,\n\nFig. S8\n\nC\n).
