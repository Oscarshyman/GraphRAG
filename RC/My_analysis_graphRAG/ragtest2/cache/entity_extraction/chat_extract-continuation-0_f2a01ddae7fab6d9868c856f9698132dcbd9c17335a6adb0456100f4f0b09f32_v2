Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

The entry\n\n–\ndelay effect\n\nof Baf at the tested dose range was weaker than that of CQ:\nUnder strong serum stimulation (20%), the EdU\n+\npercentage of\n\ncells with either the treatment of 50 nM Baf or DMSO control did\n\nnot show a significant difference at either the 19th hour (Fig. 4\n\nE\n)\n\nor 24th hour (green arrow in Fig. 4\n\nB\n,\nLower\n); however, under\n\nreduced serum stimulation strength (6%) and longer observation\n\ntime window, the effect of Baf becomes clear in causing a delayed\n\nhalf-activation time of the quiescence-exit cell population com-\npared to the DMSO control (Fig. 4\n\nF\n).\n\nAs seen in Fig. 4\n\nB\n, a short but strong inhibition of lysosomal\n\nfunction by CQ treatment (6 h, 20\n\n/uni03BC\nM) deepened quiescence; the\n\nvast majority of cells were still EdU\n−\nat the 24th hour after 20%\n\nserum stimulation. However, these cells were reversible and\n\nbecame EdU\n+\nby the 48th hour (Fig. 4\n\nG\n). In comparison, a\n\nprolonged lysosomal inhibition by CQ treatment at a lower dose\n(54 h, 5\n\n/uni03BC\nM) drove a significant subpopulation of quiescent cells\n\ninto a more irreversible state: As seen in Fig. 4\n\nH\n, 41.4\n±\n2.9%\n\nsuch treated cells remained EdU\n−\nafter 48 h of 20% serum\n\nstimulation; in comparison,\n\n<\n2.5% of nontreated control cells\n\nremained EdU\n−\n(Fig. 4\n\nH\n). This result in quiescent cells may be\n\nrelated to earlier findings that a repeated or long exposure to\n\nsublethal stresses can effectively induce proliferating cells to\nsenescence (37, 38). In addition to the irreversible phenotype, we\nfound that long-term CQ exposed qu\niescent cells exhibited other\n\nhallmarks of senescence: A significantly increased\n\nβ\n-galactosidase\n\nactivity (\n\nP\n=\n0.011 in 1-tailed\nt\ntest) (Fig. 4\nI\n) and hypertrophy with a\n\nsignificantly increased cell size upon serum stimulation (\n\nP\n=\n0.003 in\n\n1-tailed\n\nt\ntest) (Fig. 4\nJ\n). Taken together, our data suggest that an\n\nimpairment of lysosomal function in quiescent cells can lead to deep\n\nquiescence and potentially a senescence-like state.\n\nEnhancing Lysosomal Function Pushes Cells toward Shallower Quiescence.\n\nIf the impaired lysosomal function is responsible for quiescence\n\ndeepening, enhancing such function will likely counteract this trend\n\nand push cells into shallower quiescence. Consistent with this hy-\n\npothesis, we observed that nutrient starvation, a known inducer of\nautophagy, pushed cells into shallo\nwer quiescence: Serum-starved\n\nREF cells treated with PBS (i.e., unde\nr additional nutrient starvation)\n\nfor 320 min showed significantly higher E2f-ON% (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.\n\nS6\n\nA\n)andEdU\n +\n%(\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S6\n B\n) upon serum stimulation\n\nthan treated with control (i.e., wit\nhout nutrient starvation). This re-\n\nsult is similar to what was previous\nly observed in quiescent neural\n\nstem cells (NSCs) (39). However, nut\nrient starvation induces a range\n\nof cellular responses (e.g., AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition)\nin addition to autophagy. To increa\nse lysosomal function directly, we\n\nsought to enhance lysosomal gene\nexpression and biogenesis in REF\n\ncells. Lysosomal gene expression and biogenesis can be up-regulated\n\nby a MiT/TFE family of transcript\nion factors Tfeb, Mitf, and Tfe3,\n\nwhich bind to a CLEAR-box sequence upstream of many lysosomal\ngenes and are known as the master re\ngulator of lysosome biogenesis\nA\n\nC\n BEF\n\nG\nD\n\nI\nH\n\nJ\n\nFig. 4.\n\nLysosomal inhibition pushes cells into deeper quiescence and senescent-like state.
