Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

Altogether, our study suggests that increased lyso-\n\nsomal mass (containing damaged lysosomes) is both partially\n\ncaused by and contributes to decreased lysosomal function and\nautophagic clearance in deep quiescence.\n\nInhibiting Lysosomal Function Deepens Cellular Quiescence.\nOur next\nquestion concerns whether the decreased lysosomal function is\n\ncausal to, or merely a consequence of, deep quiescence. If de-\n\ncreased lysosomal function causes deep quiescence, we expect\nthat inhibiting lysosomal function in quiescent cells would fur-\n\nther deepen quiescence and that increasing lysosomal function\n\nwould lead to shallow quiescence.\nTo test this idea, we first performed pharmacological in-\nhibition of lysosomal function and measured corresponding\nchanges in quiescence depth (Fig. 4\n\nA\n). As seen in Fig. 1\nA\nand\nB\n,\n\ndeep quiescent cells under longer-term serum starvation both\n\nrequire a higher serum concentration and take a longer time to\nreenter the cell cycle. This result is consistent with our earlier\n\nstudy with targeted perturbations (although the relative degree\nof required increases in serum concentration and time may vary\n\ndepending on the specific quiescence-deepening factors) (14).\n\nHere we used at least 1 consistent indicator, the minimum serum\n\nconcentration required for cell cycle reentry, to measure quies-\n\ncence depth throughout this study.\n\nWe applied 2 lysosomal inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and\n\nchloroquine (CQ), that prevent lysosomal acidification (36). A\nshort exposure (6 h) to either drug was sufficient to inhibit ly-\n\nsosomal function in REF cells, evident by the impaired pro-\n\nteolytic degradation within the lysosomal compartment (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n, Fig. S5\nA\n). When quiescent cells were treated with\n\neither of these 2 lysosomal inhibitors, increasingly higher serum\nconcentrations were required to activate cells to reenter the cell\n\ncycle, in a drug dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4\n\nB\n–\nD\n; red arrow\n\npoints to serum concentration for activating\n\n∼\n50% of cells, judged\n\nbased on EdU incorporation, E2f-GFP reporter, and propidium\n\niodide [PI] staining, respectively). Correspondingly, at a given\nserum concentration (e.g., 4% serum), a decreasing percentage of\n\ncells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU\n+\n)withanincreasing\n\ndose of either lysosomal inhibitor, Baf or CQ (Fig. 4\n\nB\n). The ly-\n\nsosomal inhibition-caused quiescence deepening occurred re-\n\ngardless of the preceding quiescence depth before drug treatment:\n\nAs shown in\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S5\n B\n, a higher serum concentration\n\nwas required to activate drug-treated (blue curve) than nontreated\n\n(red curve) cells at all test conditions (serum-starvation days).\n\nConsistently, cells took longer time to reenter the cell cycle\n\nunder the treatments of lysosomal inhibitors Baf and CQ.
