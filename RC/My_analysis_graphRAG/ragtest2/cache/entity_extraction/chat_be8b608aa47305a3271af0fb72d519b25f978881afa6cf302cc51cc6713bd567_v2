Conclusions\nUnlike conventional proliferation-origin senescence, quiescence-origin senescence\ninvolves the direct transition of quiescent cells to senescence. It represents a previously\nunderstudied new type of cellular aging process (Figure 1). Given that the vast majority of\ncells in the human body are in quiescence, not in proliferation, quiescence-origin senescenceBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 6 of 8\n\nis expected to be responsible for a larger proportion of irreversibly arrested senescent cells\nin our tissues than previously realized.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the continuum of quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition through quiescence deepening has important implications for multiple areas of\nbiomedical research and clinical practice, such as cancer biology, aging, and regenerative\nmedicine. Future research will reveal both common and cell type-speciﬁc mechanisms\nof quiescence-depth regulation and transition to senescence, identify speciﬁc molecular\nmarkers, and suggest the optimal strategies to target this group of previously overlooked\nsenescent cells to reshape our approaches to promoting health and longevity.\nFunding:This research was partially supported\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Quiescence is a state where cells are in a non-dividing, metabolically inactive phase, which is crucial for cellular aging processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>MECHANISM<|>Senescence is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that can occur as a result of various stressors, including aging and damage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELL<|>CELL<|>Cells are the basic structural and functional units of all living organisms, and they can exist in various states such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Cancer biology is the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer development and progression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, which is associated with a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>CLINICAL PRACTICE<|>Regenerative medicine is a field of medicine that aims to repair or replace damaged cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>MOLECULE<|>Molecular markers are biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that can indicate a normal or abnormal process, or a condition or disease.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence-origin senescence involves the transition of quiescent cells to senescence, indicating a direct relationship between these two mechanisms of cellular aging.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>AGING<|>Understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and senescence has important implications for cancer biology and aging research, as both processes are linked to cellular health and disease.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGING<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Research in aging can inform strategies in regenerative medicine, particularly in targeting senescent cells to promote health and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CANCER BIOLOGY<|>The study of quiescence is relevant to cancer biology, as quiescent cells can contribute to tumor dormancy and resistance to therapy.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>REGENERATIVE MEDICINE<|>Targeting senescent cells is a potential strategy in regenerative medicine to improve health outcomes and longevity.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOLECULAR MARKERS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Identifying specific molecular markers can help in understanding the regulation of quiescence and its transition to senescence.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [cell, molecule, gene, biomedical research, clinical practice, mechanism, quiescence, senescence, autophagy, stem cell, oxidative stress, lysosome, growth factor, extracellular fluid, microenvironment]\ntext:\n.

In particular, we\n\nfound that lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass (in-\n\ndicated by the intensity of lysosomal staining and the number of\n\nlysosomes per cell) continuously increase as quiescence deepens;\n\nhowever, autophagy flux decreases. Lysosomes are hydrolytic\n\nenzyme-filled organelles in the cell that break down many types of\n\nbiomolecules; lysosomal function, primarily through processes of\n\nautophagy and endocytosis, has been shown to prevent irreversible\n\ncellular states, such as senescenc\ne, terminal differentiation, and\n\nSignificance\nReactivating sleep-like quiescent cells in the body (most nota-\n\nbly stem cells) to divide is fundamental to tissue homeostasis\n\nand regeneration. Like sleep having shallow and deep stages,\nquiescence exhibits graded depths with different speeds and\nrates responding to stimulation signals. Understanding how\n\nquiescence depth is regulated is fundamental to our under-\n\nstanding of tissue repair and regeneration. Here we show that\nquiescence depth is regulated like a\n\n“\ndimmer switch\n”\nby lyso-\n\nsomes (cell organelles that break down and recycle biomole-\n\ncules), through the lysosomal function of reducing oxidative\nstress.

We show that lysosomal\nfunction, like a dimmer switch, cont\ninuously regulates quiescence\n\ndepth and thus the proliferative potential of quiescent cells by re-\n\nducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We\n\nfound that a set of\n\n“\nsenescence core signature\n”\ngenes (19) show\n\nsimilar expression patterns in deep quiescence as in senescence, and\nthat a gene-expression signature w\ne developed to indicate cellular\n\nquiescence depth by comparing deep and shallow quiescent REF\n\ncells is able to correctly classify senescent and aging cells in a wide\narray of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo (22, 23),\n\nsuggesting that deep quiescence may serve as a common transition\n\npath from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\n\nResults\nDynamic Transcriptome Changes during Quiescence Deepening.\nSimilar\n\nto our previous observation (14), REF cells moved into deeper\nquiescence progressively with longer-term serum starvation. After\n2-d serum starvation, the entire cell population entered quiescence, as\n\ndemonstrated by their negative D\nNA incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2\n′\n-\n\ndeoxyuridine (EdU) and a complete shut-off of E2f1 expression (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S1\n B\n). E2f1 is a member of the E2f family of tran-\n\nscription factors; it up-regulates a large battery of genes involved in\n\nDNA replication and cell cycle progression, acting as the key ef-\n\nfector of an Rb-E2f bistable switch that controls the all-or-none\ntransition from quiescence to proliferation (24, 25). With in-\n\ncreasingly longer serum starvati\non, cells moved into deeper quies-\n\ncence, requiring a longer time and a greater serum stimulation\nstrength (concentration) to reen\nter the cell cycle than cells in\n\nshallower quiescence. For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
