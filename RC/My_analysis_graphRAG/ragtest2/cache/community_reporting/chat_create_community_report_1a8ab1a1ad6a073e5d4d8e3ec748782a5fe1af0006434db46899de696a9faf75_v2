This down-regulation indicates that CDK2 is not only a facilitator of cell division but also plays a significant role in maintaining cellular states, particularly quiescence. Understanding CDK2's function can provide insights into how cells decide to enter quiescence, which is vital for cancer biology, as many tumors exploit quiescent states to evade therapies.
