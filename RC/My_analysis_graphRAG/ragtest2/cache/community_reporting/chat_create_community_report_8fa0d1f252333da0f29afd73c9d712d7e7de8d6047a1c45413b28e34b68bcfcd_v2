These interactions highlight the importance of the microenvironment in determining the fate of quiescent cells, as it shapes their responses and overall functionality within biological systems.\",100\n286,QUIESCENCE,MATHEMATICAL MODEL,\"The mathematical model connects extracellular fluid flow to the regulation of quiescence, providing a theoretical framework for understanding this relationship.\",100\n296,QUIESCENCE,HYDRODYNAMIC SHEAR STRESS,\"Hydrodynamic shear stress generated by extracellular fluid flow can influence quiescence depth and cellular responses, linking mechanical forces to cellular behavior.\",100\n297,QUIESCENCE,MICROFLUIDIC SYSTEM,\"The microfluidic system allows for the study of cellular quiescence under controlled flow conditions, providing insights into how fluid dynamics affect quiescence depth.\",100\n298,QUIESCENCE,DYNAMIC MICROENVIRONMENTS,\"Dynamic microenvironments can significantly impact the behavior of quiescent cells, affecting their activation and responses to injury.\",100\n299,QUIESCENCE,NUTRIENTS,\"The availability of nutrients in the extracellular fluid can influence the quiescent state of cells, affecting their metabolic activity and readiness to reenter the cell cycle.\",100\n300,QUIESCENCE,CELL MORPHOLOGY,\"Quiescence and cell morphology are interrelated concepts in cellular biology. Cell morphology can undergo changes in response to quiescence, a state where cells are metabolically inactive but can be reactivated under certain conditions. Additionally, external mechanical forces can influence these morphological changes, highlighting the dynamic relationship between quiescence and environmental factors. Therefore, alterations in cell morphology serve as indicators of a cell's quiescent state and its responsiveness to various external stimuli. This interplay underscores the importance of understanding how quiescence affects cellular structure and behavior in different contexts.\",100\n301,QUIESCENCE,CELL GROWTH,\"Cell growth is regulated by the quiescent state of cells, as quiescent cells are typically non-dividing and metabolically inactive.\",100\n302,QUIESCENCE,CELL MIGRATION,\"Cell migration can be influenced by the quiescent state of cells, as quiescent cells may exhibit altered migratory behavior in response to their environment.\",100\n314,QUIESCENCE,SERUM-STIMULATION MEDIUM,\"Quiescence is induced by serum starvation, and the transition out of quiescence is triggered by serum-stimulation medium.\",100\n321,QUIESCENCE,E2F-GFP REPORTER,\"The E2F-GFP reporter is used to assess the quiescent state of cells, providing a direct measure of their transition between quiescence and proliferation.\",100\n324,QUIESCENCE,STATIC MEDIUM,\"The entity \"\"QUIESCENCE\"\" is closely related to the \"\"STATIC MEDIUM\"\" in the context of cellular behavior. Cells cultured in a static medium are observed to enter a deeper state of quiescence compared to those exposed to extracellular fluid flow. This deeper quiescence impacts their responsiveness to serum stimulation, indicating that the lack of flow dynamics in the static medium plays a crucial role in altering cellular activity. Furthermore, the exit from quiescence is inhibited in static medium, reinforcing the idea that the flow dynamics of the medium significantly influence cellular behavior and their ability to transition out of quiescence.
