Quiescent cells interact closely with their microenvironment, which significantly influences their behavior and response to various stimuli, including the depth of their quiescent state. The microenvironment provides a range of signals that can either promote or inhibit quiescence, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating cellular states. These interactions highlight the importance of the microenvironment in determining the fate of quiescent cells, as it shapes their responses and overall functionality within biological systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974167, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 311, "total_tokens": 428, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
