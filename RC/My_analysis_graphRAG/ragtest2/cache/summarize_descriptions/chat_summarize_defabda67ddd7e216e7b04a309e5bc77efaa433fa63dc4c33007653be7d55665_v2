By utilizing RNA-seq, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how gene expression is regulated in these states, thereby enhancing knowledge in fields such as developmental biology, aging research, and cellular response mechanisms.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974154, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
