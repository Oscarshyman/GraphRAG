This condition is commonly employed in research to induce quiescence, a state where cells enter a period of dormancy and cease to divide. During serum starvation, cells exhibit alterations in gene expression and various cellular responses, including changes in lysosomal mass and autophagy. Researchers utilize this technique to study how cells respond to low nutrient availability and to investigate the mechanisms governing reentry into the cell cycle. Overall, serum starvation serves as a critical method in cell culture, allowing for controlled studies of cellular responses under nutrient-deprived conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974156, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 475, "total_tokens": 610, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
