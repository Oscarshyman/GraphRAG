This state is distinct from senescence and is often induced by conditions such as serum starvation. Cells in deep quiescence require stronger stimuli to re-enter the cell cycle, making them less likely to exit this dormant state. Additionally, deep quiescence is associated with impaired lysosomal function, further contributing to the cells' metabolic inactivity and lack of proliferation. Overall, deep quiescence represents a prolonged period of dormancy where cells are at risk of transitioning to senescence, highlighting its importance in studies of cell behavior under stress and the mechanisms governing cellular responses to environmental cues.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974150, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 515, "total_tokens": 657, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
