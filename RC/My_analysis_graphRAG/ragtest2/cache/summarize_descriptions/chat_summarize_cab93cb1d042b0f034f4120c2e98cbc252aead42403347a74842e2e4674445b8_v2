Specifically, the flow of extracellular fluid affects the depth of cellular quiescence, with higher flow rates resulting in shallower quiescence and an increased likelihood of cells reentering the cell cycle. This phenomenon is attributed to the generation of both physical and biochemical cues by the extracellular fluid, which drive cells towards a state of shallow quiescence, thereby directly impacting their dormancy. Furthermore, extracellular fluid flow sensitizes cells to serum growth signals, contributing to a shallower quiescence state. It also provides biochemical cues that lower the activation threshold for the Rb-E2F bistable switch, facilitating the transition from dormancy to active cell division. Overall, the presence of extracellular fluid flow is crucial in modulating the depth of quiescence in cells, highlighting the intricate relationship between fluid dynamics and cellular behavior.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974167, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 184, "prompt_tokens": 426, "total_tokens": 610, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
