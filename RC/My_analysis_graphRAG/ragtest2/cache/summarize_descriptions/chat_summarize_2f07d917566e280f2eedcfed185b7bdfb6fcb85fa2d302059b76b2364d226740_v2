This state allows cells to more readily exit quiescence and re-enter the cell cycle with minimal stimulation. In this context, shallow quiescence facilitates a quicker response to both growth signals and environmental changes, making it a crucial phase for cellular adaptation and proliferation. Overall, shallow quiescence represents a transitional state that enhances the likelihood of cellular reactivation in response to external stimuli.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974150, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 425, "total_tokens": 529, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
