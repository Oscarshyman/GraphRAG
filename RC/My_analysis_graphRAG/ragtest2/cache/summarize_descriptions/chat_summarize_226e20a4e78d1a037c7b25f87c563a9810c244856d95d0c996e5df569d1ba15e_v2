It directly influences the depth of quiescence, indicating a significant relationship between the mechanisms of quiescence and cell proliferation. Additionally, the activation threshold of the Rb-E2F bistable switch can be modulated by extracellular fluid flow, further impacting the transition from a quiescent state to cellular proliferation.
