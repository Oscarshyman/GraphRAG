These cells possess the unique ability to switch between dormancy and self-renewal, allowing them to adapt to the physiological needs of the body. Under certain conditions, HSCs can enter states of quiescence and senescence, which are characterized by a temporary halt in their proliferation and a decline in their functional capabilities, respectively. Additionally, HSCs exhibit changes in function and behavior as they age, which can impact their efficiency in blood cell production and overall contribution to the immune system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974154, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 366, "total_tokens": 507, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
