These cells are primarily studied to elucidate the mechanisms underlying quiescence and their responses to serum stimulation under various conditions. Research involving REF/E23 cells also explores the effects of extracellular fluid flow and serum on quiescence, establishing a connection between these factors in the context of cellular dormancy. Additionally, REF/E23 cells can be induced into a quiescent state within microfluidic devices, facilitating the investigation of cellular responses in a controlled environment. Overall, REF/E23 cells serve as a valuable model for studying the dynamics of cellular dormancy and the factors influencing quiescence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974167, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 376, "total_tokens": 530, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
