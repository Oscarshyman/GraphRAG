Specifically, changes in lysosomal gene expression are linked to alterations in lysosomal mass, indicating that as cells experience deeper states of quiescence, there is a corresponding increase in lysosomal gene expression. This correlation suggests that the regulation of lysosomal gene expression plays a crucial role in modulating lysosomal mass, highlighting the dynamic nature of lysosomal function in response to cellular metabolic states.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974165, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
