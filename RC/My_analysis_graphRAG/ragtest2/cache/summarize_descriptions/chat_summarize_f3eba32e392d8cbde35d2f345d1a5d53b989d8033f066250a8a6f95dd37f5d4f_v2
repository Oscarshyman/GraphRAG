It is primarily utilized as a viscosity modifier in culture media, which influences shear stress and subsequently affects cellular responses. Dextran's ability to modify viscosity is crucial for manipulating cell behavior, including the study of cellular quiescence and the conditions under which cells exit this state. Through its application, Dextran aids researchers in exploring the depth of quiescence in different culture conditions, thereby enhancing the understanding of cellular proliferation and responses. Overall, Dextran serves as an essential tool in biological studies, facilitating the investigation of complex cellular dynamics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974155, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 408, "total_tokens": 545, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
