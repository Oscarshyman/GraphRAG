These populations are often studied using advanced techniques like RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which allows for detailed examination of gene expression profiles. Additionally, cell populations can demonstrate collective behaviors and responses to various stimuli, including the processes of quiescence exit and cellular proliferation. This dual perspective highlights the importance of understanding both the individual characteristics of cells within a population and their interactions and responses as a cohesive group in the context of biomedical research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974154, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_86d0290411", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 400, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
