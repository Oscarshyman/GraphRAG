Cells can transition from shallow quiescence, which is characterized as a less stable state, to deep quiescence. In shallow quiescence, cells are more responsive to external stimuli and have a higher likelihood of re-entering the cell cycle. In contrast, deep quiescence represents a more stable state of dormancy, where cells are less likely to respond to stimuli. This dynamic between the two states highlights the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular behavior and the potential for cells to shift between different levels of quiescence based on environmental cues.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1743974165, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_b376dfbbd5", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 298, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
