-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [research article, person, cell type, biological process, gene, institution, factor]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Quiescence Deepening Is Linked to Cellular Senescence and Aging.

Finally, we examined whether and how deep quiescence in REF

cells is related to the quiescent states of other cell types (case Q)
and other nongrowth cellular states, such as senescence (case S).

To this end, we first developed a gene-expression signature in-

dicating the quiescence depth in REF cells by performing a
linear regression analysis of the time-course RNA-seq data (see

Materials and Methods

for details). To identify a signature that

corresponds to a deepening of quiescence as opposed to simply

halting the cell cycle, we omitted the proliferating sample (0 d) from
the analysis and used samples corresponding to 2- to 16-d
serum

starvation (i.e., shallow to deep quiescence) to build the regression

model. We next applied this quiescence-depth signature to other
publicly available RNA-seq datase
ts related to cases Q and S, above.
