The reactivation of quiescent cells to proliferate is fundamental to

tissue repair and homeostasis in the body. Often referred to as the

G0 state, quiescence is, however, not a uniform state but with graded
depth. Shallow quiescent cells exhibit a higher tendency to revert to
proliferation than deep quiescent cells, while deep quiescent cells

are still fully reversible under physiological conditions, distinct from

senescent cells. Cellular mechani
sms underlying the control of quies-

cence depth and the connection between quiescence and senescence

are poorly characterized, representing a missing link in our under-

standing of tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Here we measured
transcriptome changes as rat embryonic fibroblasts moved from
shallow to deep quiescence over time in the absence of growth

signals. We found that lysosomal gene expression was significantly

up-regulated in deep quiescence, an
d partially compensated for grad-

ually reduced autophagy flux. Reduc
ing lysosomal function drove

cells progressively deeper into qui
escence and eventually into a

senescence-like irreversibly arrested state; increasing lysosomal func-

tion, by lowering oxidative stress
, progressively pushed cells into

shallower quiescence. That is, lys
osomal function modulates graded

quiescence depth betwe
en proliferation and senescence as a dimmer

switch. Finally, we found that a gene-
expression signature developed

by comparing deep and shallow quiescence in fibroblasts can cor-
rectly classify a wide array of senescent and aging cell types in vitro

and in vivo, suggesting that while qui
escence is generally considered

to protect cells from irreversible a
rrest of senescence, quiescence

deepening likely represents a common transition path from cell pro-
liferation to senescence, related to aging.

C
ell proliferation in multicellular organisms is tightly regu-

lated, and the vast majority of cells in the body stay dormant

and out of the cell cycle at any given moment. The dormant

state, when reversible upon growth signals, is referred to as

cellular quiescence. Quiescence protects cells against stress and
irreversible arrest, such as senescence; it is fundamental to many
physiological phenomena, such as stem cell homeostasis and

tissue repair (1

–
4). Consequently, dysregulation of cellular qui-

escence can lead to a range of hyper- and hypoproliferative
diseases, including cancer and aging (5

–
7).

It becomes increasingly recognized that quiescence is a het-

erogeneous state with graded depth. For example, following in-
jury, muscle and neural stem cells at noninjury sites in the body
move adaptively into shallower quiescence (alert or primed

quiescent phase), positioning cells to more quickly respond to

injury and reenter the cell cycle when needed (8, 9). In other
cases, cells move into deep quiescence and require stronger

growth stimulation and longer times to reenter the cell cycle, as

seen in hepatocytes upon partial hepatectomy in older rats than
in younger ones (10, 11). Similarly, the quiescent state deepens
in cells that are cultured longer under quiescence-inducing sig-

nals, such as contact inhibition (12, 13) and serum starvation
(14). Deep quiescent cells can still revert to proliferation under

physiological conditions, appearing distinct from irreversibly

arrested senescent cells (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S1
A
). A graded qui-

escence depth indicates graded potentials for tissue repair and

regeneration; yet, how quiescence depth is regulated in the cell

and the connection between deep quiescence and senescence are

not well understood.

In this study, we investigate what regulates quiescence depth in

rat embryonic fibroblast (REF) cells. We identified sequential

transcriptome changes as cells move progressively deeper into

quiescence under longer-term serum starvation. In particular, we

found that lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass (in-

dicated by the intensity of lysosomal staining and the number of

lysosomes per cell) continuously increase as quiescence deepens;

however, autophagy flux decreases. Lysosomes are hydrolytic

enzyme-filled organelles in the cell that break down many types of

biomolecules; lysosomal function, primarily through processes of

autophagy and endocytosis, has been shown to prevent irreversible

cellular states, such as senescenc
e, terminal differentiation, and

Significance
Reactivating sleep-like quiescent cells in the body (most nota-

bly stem cells) to divide is fundamental to tissue homeostasis

and regeneration. Like sleep having shallow and deep stages,
quiescence exhibits graded depths with different speeds and
rates responding to stimulation signals. Understanding how

quiescence depth is regulated is fundamental to our under-

standing of tissue repair and regeneration. Here we show that
quiescence depth is regulated like a

“
dimmer switch
”
by lyso-

somes (cell organelles that break down and recycle biomole-

cules), through the lysosomal function of reducing oxidative
stress. We developed a gene signature to predict quiescence
depth and show that quiescence deepening likely represents a

transition path from cell division to irreversibly arrested se-

nescence, related to the aging process.

apoptosis (15
–
18). Here we found that the increased lysosomal mass

in deep quiescent cells is, in part, due to decreased autophagy flux,

which is partially but not fully compensated by increased lysosomal

gene expression and lysosomal biogenesis. We show that lysosomal
function, like a dimmer switch, cont
inuously regulates quiescence

depth and thus the proliferative potential of quiescent cells by re-

ducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We

found that a set of

genes (19) show

similar expression patterns in deep quiescence as in senescence, and
that a gene-expression signature w
e developed to indicate cellular

quiescence depth by comparing deep and shallow quiescent REF

cells is able to correctly classify senescent and aging cells in a wide
array of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo (22, 23),

suggesting that deep quiescence may serve as a common transition

path from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.


Results
Dynamic Transcriptome Changes during Quiescence Deepening.
Similar

to our previous observation (14), REF cells moved into deeper
quiescence progressively with longer-term serum starvation. After
2-d serum starvation, the entire cell population entered quiescence, as

demonstrated by their negative D
NA incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2
′
-

deoxyuridine (EdU) and a complete shut-off of E2f1 expression (

SI

Appendix

,Fig.S1
 B
). E2f1 is a member of the E2f family of tran-

scription factors; it up-regulates a large battery of genes involved in

DNA replication and cell cycle progression, acting as the key ef-

fector of an Rb-E2f bistable switch that controls the all-or-none
transition from quiescence to proliferation (24, 25). With in-

creasingly longer serum starvati
on, cells moved into deeper quies-

cence, requiring a longer time and a greater serum stimulation
strength (concentration) to reen
ter the cell cycle than cells in

shallower quiescence. For example, when the duration of serum

starvation increased gradually fr
om 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry

time upon 20% serum stimulation increased from

<
19 h to
∼
25 h

(to achieve

∼
60% EdU
+
rate) (Fig. 1
A
and
SI Appendix
,Fig.S1
 C
),

and the serum concentration req
uired for cell cycle reentry in-

creased from

<
2% to
∼
8% (to achieve
∼
60% EdU
+
measured at

the 25th hour of serum stimulation) (Fig. 1

B
). This result is con-

sistent with our earlier findings that the time and serum threshold
required for cell cycle reentry are 2
related features that both reflect

the same biological state, the quiescence depth (14). Importantly,

deep quiescent cells were not irre
versibly arrested. For example,

upon 20% serum stimulation, 92.
6% of 16-d serum-starved deep

quiescent REF cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU
+
)

within 41 h (

SI Appendix
,Fig.S1
 B
).

To identify molecular mechanisms regulating quiescence
depth at the transcriptional level, we performed RNA-sequencing

(RNA-seq) analysis of 0- to 16-d serum-starved cells (26). As

expected, the expression of well-characterized proliferation
genes

such as E2f1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 (

)
—


E2f1 target genes (

SI Appendix
,Fig.S2
 B
), and proliferation-

related gene clusters (#7 and 9,

SI Appendix
,Fig.S2
 C
)was

quickly down-regulated within 2-d serum starvation. Conversely,
the expression of growth inhibitory genes, such as Rb1, Cdkn1a
(p21Cip1), and Cdkn1b (p27Kip1), was up-regulated upon se-

rum starvation (

SI Appendix
,Fig.S2
 A
). The expression of Cdkn2a

(p16INK4A), a senescence marker (27), remained low as cells
moved deeper in quiescence (3- to 16-d serum starvation) (

SI

Appendix

,Fig.S2
 D
), consistent with quiescence being a

reversible state.

The global gene-expression profile changed drastically when
cells transitioned from proliferation to quiescence (0- to 2-d

serum starvation) and continued to change sequentially as cells

moved from shallow to deep quiescence (2- to 16-d serum star-
vation) (Fig. 1

C
). This sequential change was reflected in 9 gene

clusters that exhibited different temporal dynamic patterns (Fig.

2

A
and
B
). In particular, the expression of 2 gene clusters

appeared to be positively correlated with quiescence deepening
and increased monotonically as cells moved from shallow to

deep quiescence (clusters 1 and 3) (Fig. 2

B
). In cluster 1, mul-

tiple biological functions were enriched; among them, lysosome

was overall the most statistically significant in Kyoto Encyclo-

pedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) overrepresentation tests

[Fig. 2

C
, using clusterProfiler (28);
SI Appendix
, Fig. S2
C
, using

DAVID (29)]. In cluster 3, lysosome was the single function

significantly enriched statistically (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S2
C
). Con-

sistently, lysosomal genes also had the strongest positive corre-

lation with deep quiescence in gene set enrichment analysis

(GSEA) (30) (normalized enrichment score [NES]

=
3.12)

(Fig. 2

D
).

Lysosomal Gene Expression and Lysosomal Mass Increase as Quiescence

Deepens.
The vast majority of lysosomal genes, encoding for various

lysosomal enzymes, activator proteins, membrane proteins, and ion

channel proteins, increased their expression continuously as cells

moved from shallow to deep quiescence (Fig. 2

E
[cluster C and the

bottom half of cluster A], Fig. 2

F
,and
 SI Appendix
,Fig.S3
 A
). As a

comparison, the expression of most genes associated with endo-

somes, another cellular organelle in the endosomal

–
lysosomal sys-

tem, only increased significantly during the first 2 d of serum

starvation but not afterward as quiescence continued to deepen
(Fig. 2

F
and
SI Appendix
,Fig.S3
 B
and
C
).

Lysosomal mass also increased in deep quiescence: Following

a brief pulsatile adaptive response (within the first 6 h) upon

serum starvation, lysosomal mass continuously increased over

the next 14 d, as seen from the stained LysoTracker intensity

(Fig. 2

G
). The initial pulsatile response of lysosomal mass was

likely due to an adaptive mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR)-autophagy response to serum starvation, as previously

reported (31). The continuously increased LysoTracker intensity

in deep quiescence was consistent with an increased number of

lysosomes, another indicator of lysosomal mass; for example,

11-d serum-starved cells exhibited significantly more lysosomal foci

per cell and per unit area of cell than 2-d serum-starved cells (per

Lysosomal Function and Lysosome Destruction Decrease as Quiescence

Deepens.
We thought the increases of both lysosomal gene expres-

sion and lysosomal mass as quiescence deepens would lead to an

increase of lysosomal function. Instead, we found that autophagy
flux, an indicator for the primary lysosomal function, did not in-

crease but gradually declined as cells moved deeper into quiescence,

as seen in an LC3-II turnover assay (32) (Fig. 3

A
). This result posed

2 immediate questions: 1) What is the relationship between in-

creased lysosomal mass and gene expression to decreased lysosomal

function? 2) Does declined lysosomal function cause quiescence
deepening and, if so, how?
An increase of lysosomal mass can be caused by an increase of
lysosome biogenesis or a decrease of lysosome destruction or

both. Since lysosome itself is destructed via an autophagic pro-

cess named lysophagy (33, 34), the declined autophagy flux we
observed in cells with prolonged serum starvation (Fig. 3

A
)

suggests that the rate of lysosome destruction likely declines

accordingly in deep quiescence. If this is the case, when we in-
hibit autophagy/losophagy, we expect that 1) lysosomal mass will

increase in cells, and 2) the degree of increase (fold-change) will

be smaller in deep than shallow quiescent cells. Indeed, when we
treated 2-, 5-, and 8-d serum-starved quiescent cells with an

autophagy inhibitor (nocodazole or vinblastine) (35) to repress

autophagy/lysophagy (as seen by decreased autophagy flux in
LC3 turnover assay) (Fig. 3

B
), we found that the relative in-

crease of LysoTracker intensity was smaller in cells under pro-

longed starvation (Fig. 3

C
and
D
). Although the result should be

taken with caveat since nocodazole and vinblastine are general
autophagy inhibitors but not specific lysophagy inhibitors (which

are lacking in the field to the best of our knowledge), and thus

may cause other side effects, this result, together with decreased
autophagy (Fig. 3

A
), suggested that lysosome destruction de-

creased as quiescence deepened. Insufficient lysosome destruc-

tion by autophagy/lysophagy can lead to an accumulation of
damaged lysosomes in the cell, which in turn interferes with ly-

sosomal homeostasis and function (34).

Interestingly, while blocking autophagy/lysophagy by either

nocodazole or vinblastine increased the LysoTracker intensity in

quiescent REF cells, it did not increase the number of lysosomes
(

SI Appendix
, Fig. S4
A
and
C
) and even decreased the lysosomal

number over time (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S4
B
and
D
). This result is

different from the increased lysosomal number we observed,
along with quiescence deepening (Fig. 2

H
); it suggests that de-

creased lysosome destruction was not the only factor contribut-

ing to the increase of lysosomal mass in deep quiescent cells.
Indeed, increased lysosome biogenesis (consistent with the in-

creased lysosomal gene expression, as seen in Fig. 2

E
and
F
) also

played a role in this process, as we will explain further in the

Discussion

. Altogether, our study suggests that increased lyso-

somal mass (containing damaged lysosomes) is both partially

caused by and contributes to decreased lysosomal function and
autophagic clearance in deep quiescence.

Inhibiting Lysosomal Function Deepens Cellular Quiescence.
Our next
question concerns whether the decreased lysosomal function is

causal to, or merely a consequence of, deep quiescence. If de-

creased lysosomal function causes deep quiescence, we expect
that inhibiting lysosomal function in quiescent cells would fur-

ther deepen quiescence and that increasing lysosomal function

would lead to shallow quiescence.
To test this idea, we first performed pharmacological in-
hibition of lysosomal function and measured corresponding
changes in quiescence depth (Fig. 4

A
). As seen in Fig. 1
A
and
B
,

deep quiescent cells under longer-term serum starvation both

require a higher serum concentration and take a longer time to
reenter the cell cycle. This result is consistent with our earlier

study with targeted perturbations (although the relative degree
of required increases in serum concentration and time may vary

depending on the specific quiescence-deepening factors) (14).

Here we used at least 1 consistent indicator, the minimum serum

concentration required for cell cycle reentry, to measure quies-

cence depth throughout this study.

We applied 2 lysosomal inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and

chloroquine (CQ), that prevent lysosomal acidification (36). A
short exposure (6 h) to either drug was sufficient to inhibit ly-

sosomal function in REF cells, evident by the impaired pro-

teolytic degradation within the lysosomal compartment (

SI

Appendix

, Fig. S5
A
). When quiescent cells were treated with

either of these 2 lysosomal inhibitors, increasingly higher serum
concentrations were required to activate cells to reenter the cell

cycle, in a drug dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4

B
–
D
; red arrow

points to serum concentration for activating

∼
50% of cells, judged

based on EdU incorporation, E2f-GFP reporter, and propidium

iodide [PI] staining, respectively). Correspondingly, at a given
serum concentration (e.g., 4% serum), a decreasing percentage of

cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU
+
)withanincreasing

dose of either lysosomal inhibitor, Baf or CQ (Fig. 4

B
). The ly-

sosomal inhibition-caused quiescence deepening occurred re-

gardless of the preceding quiescence depth before drug treatment:

As shown in

SI Appendix
,Fig.S5
 B
, a higher serum concentration

was required to activate drug-treated (blue curve) than nontreated

(red curve) cells at all test conditions (serum-starvation days).

Consistently, cells took longer time to reenter the cell cycle

under the treatments of lysosomal inhibitors Baf and CQ. For

example, with either the treatment of 5

2.5% of nontreated control cells

remained EdU
−
(Fig. 4

H
). This result in quiescent cells may be

related to earlier findings that a repeated or long exposure to

sublethal stresses can effectively induce proliferating cells to
senescence (37, 38). In addition to the irreversible phenotype, we
found that long-term CQ exposed qu
iescent cells exhibited other

hallmarks of senescence: A significantly increased

β
-galactosidase

activity (

P
=
0.011 in 1-tailed
t
test) (Fig. 4
I
) and hypertrophy with a

significantly increased cell size upon serum stimulation (

P
=
0.003 in

1-tailed

t
test) (Fig. 4
J
). Taken together, our data suggest that an

impairment of lysosomal function in quiescent cells can lead to deep

quiescence and potentially a senescence-like state.

Enhancing Lysosomal Function Pushes Cells toward Shallower Quiescence.

If the impaired lysosomal function is responsible for quiescence

deepening, enhancing such function will likely counteract this trend

and push cells into shallower quiescence. Consistent with this hy-

pothesis, we observed that nutrient starvation, a known inducer of
autophagy, pushed cells into shallo
wer quiescence: Serum-starved

REF cells treated with PBS (i.e., unde
r additional nutrient starvation)

for 320 min showed significantly higher E2f-ON% (

SI Appendix
,Fig.

S6

A
)andEdU
 +
%(
SI Appendix
,Fig.S6
 B
) upon serum stimulation

than treated with control (i.e., wit
hout nutrient starvation). This re-

sult is similar to what was previous
ly observed in quiescent neural

stem cells (NSCs) (39). However, nut
rient starvation induces a range

of cellular responses (e.g., AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition)
in addition to autophagy. To increa
se lysosomal function directly, we

sought to enhance lysosomal gene
expression and biogenesis in REF

cells. Lysosomal gene expression and biogenesis can be up-regulated

by a MiT/TFE family of transcript
ion factors Tfeb, Mitf, and Tfe3,

which bind to a CLEAR-box sequence upstream of many lysosomal
genes and are known as the master re
gulator of lysosome biogenesis

(40
–
43). Remarkably, the expression of Mitf and Tfe3 but not Tfeb

increased significantly in deep quiescence (Fig. 5

A

and 0.827 for Mitf, Tfe3, and Tf

rved cells); meanwhile, Mitf but

not Tfeb and Tfe3 showed a high degree of coexpression with lyso-

somal genes in quiescence (

SI Appendix
,Fig.S6
 C
). Together, these

results suggested a unique role for Mitf in regulating lysosomal
function in the quiescent REF cell model. Indeed, we found that
ectopic Mitf expression in quiescent REF cells (arrow in

SI Appendix
,

Fig. S6

D
) significantly increased both the LysoTracker intensity (
P
=


0.017 in a 1-tailed

t
test) (Fig. 5
B
and

) and lysosomal number (
SI

Appendix

,Fig.S6
 E
) in the cell, as well as enhanced autophagy flux

(higher LC3-II

/uni0394
)(Fig.5
 D
), demonstrating the ability of Mitf to

increase lysosomal biogenesis and fu
nction. Consistently, ectopic Mitf

expression pushed cells into shallower quiescence, as seen in both a

higher EdU
+
% upon serum stimulation (Fig. 5

E
) and a shorter time

to reenter the cell cycle (Fig. 5

F
). Notably, there was a monotonic

correlation between the level of i
ntroduced Mitf expression vector

(indicated by mCherry intensity) (

x
axis in Fig. 5
G
) and the
EdU
+
level upon serum stimulation (normalized to mCherry con-

trol) (

y
axis in Fig. 5
G
), suggesting that cells can be continuously

driven to shallower quiescence by enhancing lysosomal function.

Lysosomal Function Prevents Quiescence Deepening via ROS Reduction.

Lysosomes are known to play an antioxidative role in quiescent
stem cells (15, 16). Thus, here we tested whether lysosomal

function potentially prevents quiescence deepening by anti-

oxidation. If it does, we reasoned that increasing antioxidation in
the cell would reduce quiescence depth. Indeed, we found that
supplementing antioxida
nt 2-mercaptoethanol (
β
ME) drove

quiescent cells into a shallower state, from which cells became
more sensitive to growth signals (higher EdU
+
% upon serum
stimulation) (Fig. 6

A
); conversely, supplementing an oxidative

reagent tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) drove cells into deeper
quiescence, shown by the lower EdU
+
% (Fig. 6

B
) and lower E2f-

ON% (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S7
A
) upon stimulation at a given serum

concentration with increasing tBHP concentration. These results
indicate that the degree of oxidative stress is positively correlated
with quiescence depth.

Next, we found that inhibiting lysosomal function by Baf and

CQ, which deepened quiescence, increased mitochondrial ROS
level (higher MitoSox intensity) (Fig. 6

C
and
D
). Conversely,

enhancing lysosomal function by ectopic Mitf expression, which

reduced quiescence depth, suppressed mitochondrial ROS
(lower MitoSox intensity) (Fig. 6

E
) in a dose-dependent manner

(Fig. 6

F
). Consistently, tBHP blocked the effect of Mitf on re-

ducing quiescence depth: While the ectopic Mitf expression in-
creased the EdU
+
% over control, additional tBHP treatment in
Mitf-transfected cells decreased the EdU
+
% in a tBHP dose-

dependent manner (Fig. 6

G
). We also considered that lyso-

somes may prevent quiescence deepening by increasing energy
production, another known role of lysosomes (18). However,
treatment with metabolites known to increase ATP production,

such as methyl pyruvate (MPy), did not reduce quiescence depth

with statistical significance (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S7
B
); it actually

increased quiescence depth at high concentrations (

SI Appendix
,

Fig. S7

C
), indicating that ATP generation is likely not respon-

sible for how lysosomal function prevents quiescence deepening
in the tested conditions, reminiscent of similar findings in yeasts
(44). Taken together, our findings suggest that: 1) Increasing
oxidative stress deepens quiescence, and reducing oxidative

stress prevents quiescence from deepening; 2) reducing lysosomal

function increases ROS, the mediator of oxidative stress, and in-

creasing lysosomal function decreases ROS; and 3) increasing or
decreasing lysosomal function continuously modulates quiescence
depth, acting like a dimmer switch (Fig. 6

H
).

Quiescence Deepening Is Linked to Cellular Senescence and Aging.

Finally, we examined whether and how deep quiescence in REF

cells is related to the quiescent states of other cell types (case Q)
and other nongrowth cellular states, such as senescence (case S).

To this end, we first developed a gene-expression signature in-

dicating the quiescence depth in REF cells by performing a
linear regression analysis of the time-course RNA-seq data (see

Materials and Methods

for details). To identify a signature that

corresponds to a deepening of quiescence as opposed to simply

halting the cell cycle, we omitted the proliferating sample (0 d) from
the analysis and used samples corresponding to 2- to 16-d
serum

starvation (i.e., shallow to deep quiescence) to build the regression

model. We next applied this quiescence-depth signature to other
publicly available RNA-seq datase
ts related to cases Q and S, above.

As an example of case Q, dormant NSCs in vivo transition into

a shallower quiescent state called primed NSCs upon neural
injury (9). When we applied the quiescence-depth gene signature
of REF cells to the RNA-seq data corresponding to NSCs before

and after neural injury, we obtained quiescence depth scores

(QDS) from the linear regression model (see

Materials and

Methods

for details) to indicate the relative quiescence depth of

NSCs. We found that the QDS of primed NSCs after injury was
significantly smaller (i.e., shallower quiescence) than that of
dormant NSCs before injury (Fig. 7

A
). This result suggests that

the quiescence-depth signature of REF cells in vitro can predict
the relative quiescence depth of NSCs in vivo, indicating that this

gene signature may reflect shared quiescence regulatory mech-

anisms across different cell types.

To test case S, we analyzed RNA-seq datasets associated with

cellular senescence and aging by applying the QDS model with
the quiescence-depth gene signature of REF cells. Strikingly, we
found that QDS correctly predicted cellular senescence and ag-
ing in a wide array of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo

(22, 23) (Fig. 7

B
–
D
). In all 6 cell lines (BJ, IMR-90, WI-38,

HFF, MRC-5, and MDAH041) studied under replicative se-
nescence and in all 3 conditions (Adriamycin, 5-aza, and H2O2)
studied under stress-induced senescence, QDS was significantly
larger than that in proliferating controls (Fig. 7

B
). Notably, QDS

was constructed without involving proliferating samples (by

comparing shallow and deep quiescent cells under 2- to 16-d

serum starvation) and thus likely reflects a common feature

between deep quiescence and senescence. Consistently, a set of


“

senescence core signature
”
genes identified from metaanalysis

(19) exhibit similar expression changes (i.e., up- or down-regulation)

under both deep quiescence and senescence (Fig. 7

E
). Further-

more, QDS was found significantly larger in aged hematopoietic
stem cells (Fig. 7

C
) and monotonically increasing in all 11

studied rat organs undergoing agi
ng processes from juvenile to

adolescence, adult, and aged stages (Fig. 7

D
). The success of

QDS gene signature to predict both senescence in vitro and aging

in vivo suggests that quiescence deepening may share a molecular
mechanistic basis with and act as a transitional state toward se-

nescence and aging (see more in

Discussion
). Consistently, it was

recently reported that long-term cultured quiescent human fi-
broblasts eventually transit into senescence under physiological

oxygen conditions (45).

and terminal differentiation (15, 16, 18). The present study shows

that instead of a simple OFF

–
ON switch, lysosomes function as a

dimmer switch to continuously modulate quiescence depth (Fig.

6

H
) and proliferative capacity of quiescent cells.

Our study suggests that as cells move deeper in quiescence,
lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass increase, but ly-

sosomal function and lysosome destruction decrease. Decreased

lysosome destruction via autophagy/lysophagy contributes to an
increased lysosomal mass and likely an accumulation of damaged
lysosomes, which in turn contributes to a decreased lysosomal

–


autophagy function. Decreased lysosome destruction alone,

however, does not fully explain the increased lysosomal mass
(both lysoTracker intensity of lysosome number) observed in

deep quiescent cells (Fig. 2

G
and
H
), as blocking lysosome

destruction increased LysoTracker intensity but not the number
of lysosomes in REF cells (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S4); similarly, it was

reported previously that lysosomal number did not change or

even mildly decreased in autophagy-impaired fibroblasts with

Atg4B and Atg7 mutations (46). The other contributing factor of
increased lysosomal mass in deep quiescence appears to be ly-
sosomal biogenesis: The expression of Mitf, a master regulator of

lysosomal biogenesis, significantly increased the lysosomal

number (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S6
E
) in quiescent REF cells. Con-

sistently, we found that applying small chemical inhibitors to
repress Mcoln1 (also known as TRPML1) that is crucial for ly-

sosome biogenesis (47) significantly decreased lysosomal number

in quiescent REF cells (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S8
A
and
B
). The in-

crease in lysosome biogenesis itself is likely compensatory to

quiescence deepening: Mitf expression increases significantly

along with quiescence deepening (Fig. 5

A
); relatedly, inhibiting

lysosome biogenesis further deepens quiescence (lower EdU
+
%
with Mcoln1 inhibitors than with DMSO control) (

SI Appendix
,

Fig. S8

C
). The dynamic balance and relative contributions of

lysosome biogenesis and degradation destruction in deep quies-
cence await further investigation.
REF cells in deep quiescence exhibited reduced autophagy

flux (Fig. 3

A
), which may be relevant to the declined autophagy

observed in aging (15, 48

–
50) and senescent cells (17, 51). It is

unclear what resulted in declined autophagy in deep quiescence
despite increased lysosomal gene expression (Fig. 2

E
) and bio-

genesis. Note that not every lysosomal gene increased expression

with quiescence deepening: A small subset of lysosomal genes
enriched for those that also function in the Golgi network
showed a general decrease (see cluster B in Fig. 2

E
for enrich-

ment analysis and

SI Appendix
, Table S2). As the Golgi network

is critical to transporting lysosomal hydrolases from cytoplasmic
ribosomes into lysosomal vesicles (52), the reduced expression of

some of these related genes, therefore, may lead to a reduced

lysosomal

–
autophagy function. Alternatively, the
“
net
”
decrease

in lysosomal function may be adaptive and serve as a cellular
counter for serum-deprivation duration (i.e., environmental

growth restriction), which in turn determines how cautious the

cell will get before resuming growth. The exact mechanisms
dictating the relationship between lysosomal function and qui-
escence depth awaits further studies.

Our results suggest that lysosomal function prevents quies-

cence deepening via ROS reduction (Fig. 6). Previous studies
have shown that the lysosome

–
autophagy pathway reduces ROS

in several types of quiescent cells (15, 16) through mitophagy:

That is, selective autophagic degradation of damaged mito-

chondria (15). It remains to be tested whether lysosomes prevent
quiescence deepening in REF cells via mitophagy, but the re-

duced mitochondrial ROS levels resulting from enhanced lyso-

somal function (Fig. 6

E
and
F
) is consistent with this model.

It was shown previously that mTORC1 can transform muscle
stem cells into a shallower quiescent state, called GAlert, in which

cells are sensitized to growth stimulation (8). Consistently, con-

tinuous mTORC1 activation led to depletion of certain types of
quiescent stem cells in vivo by forcing cell cycle reentry (53, 54).

It is well established that mTORC1 drives cell growth and in-

hibits the lysosome-autophagy pathway (43, 55). Accordingly, the

effect of mTORC1 on quiescence depth is likely 2-sided: By
promoting cell growth, mTORC1 facilitates quiescence exit and
thus reduces quiescence depth; by inhibiting lysosomal function,

mTORC1 drives cells deeper into quiescence. In the GAlertcase,

where mTORC1 is activated both before and during stimulation,
the net result appears to be shallower quiescence. The exact
bimodal effects of mTORC1 on quiescence depth may be com-

plicated and condition-dependent, awaiting future studies.

The lysosome

–
autophagy pathway plays an important role in

cancer physiology and dormancy (5, 40, 41, 56

–
58). Activities of

MiT/TFE family members, including Tfeb and Mitf, are up-regulated

by overexpression or nuclear localization in multiple cancer types,
including lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers (41, 59, 60), which is
linked to poor prognosis and survival (59, 60). The lysosome

–
auto-

phagy pathway appears to help mai
ntain dormant cancer cells and

facilitate survival and metastasis (5). Consistently, autophagy in-
hibition decreases the viability of dormant breast cancer cells and
their metastatic recurrence, suggesting a promising treatment

strategy (57). Future studies are needed to determine the op-

timal target and degree of lysosomal

–
autophagy inhibition in treat-

ment to minimize disrupting the qu
iescence depth of normal cells.

Our study highlights that deep quiescent cells exhibit gene-

expression signatures that are similar to senescent and aged cells

(Fig. 7

B
–
E
). The enriched up-regulation of lysosomal genes

(KEGG_lysosome gene set) is shown in 10 of the 11 studied

aging tissues (adrenal gland, br
ain, heart, kidney, liver, lung,

spleen, thymus, uterus, testis,
but not muscle); it is also shown

in 5 of the 6 cell lines (BJ, IMR-90, WI-38, HFF, MRC-5, but
not MDAH041) studied under replicative senescence, but not

shown in stress (Adriamycin/5-aza/H2O2)-induced senescence in

MDAH041 cells (

SI Appendix
, Table S4). This result is consistent

with the findings that senescence and aging are partially driven
by ROS and can be counteracted by lysosome

–
autophagy activ-

ities in many but not all conditions (6, 15, 17, 61

–
63), indicating

the contributions of other potentially shared mechanisms un-
derlying deep quiescence, senescence, and aging. Among them,
DNA damage is a likely candidate, which can be caused by

various stress signals (e.g., ROS and replication stress) and is

associated with quiescence entry (64, 65) as well as cellular se-
nescence (66, 67) and aging (68, 69). Furthermore, many cellular
activities are up- or down-regulated as cells move deeper in

quiescence (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S2
C
). Some of these cellular ac-

tivities may be involved in the regulation of quiescence depth and
potentially senescence and aging, with their detailed mechanisms

awaiting further studies. In this regard, it has been shown recently

in both NSCs and bacteria that the accumulation of protein ag-
gregates is associated with quiescence deepening, and that the
clearance of protein aggregates (by lysosomes in NSCs and by

DnaK

–
ClpB complex in bacteria) drives cells to shallower quies-

cence and enhances their ability to reenter the cell cycle (39, 70).
Quiescence entry and exit are regulated by the Rb-E2f-Cyclin/
Cdk gene network (71, 72) that functions as a bistable switch

(25). How does the toggle switch-like nature of the Rb-E2f

pathway fit with the lysosomal dimmer switch? We speculate
that during quiescence exit, cells first move progressively into
shallow quiescence and at a time point, the restriction point (73,

74),

“
flip
”
into the cell cycle by committing to proliferation; the

whole process acts like adjusting a sliding dimmer before activating
a toggle switch. In this regard, i
t will be important to figure out

whether and how the lysosomal switch cross-talks with the Rb-E2f

switch in controlling quiescence
depth and exit in future studies.

Relatedly, recent in vivo studies on muscle and neural stem
cells generally invoke 2 quiescence state: 1 shallow (e.g., GAlertand primed quiescence) and 1 deep. Our findings that the gene-
expression signature we developed in the fibroblast model

in vitro can correctly classify deep (dormant) and shallow (primed)

NSCs in vivo (Fig. 7

A
) suggest a potential mechanistic link be-

tween the quiescent states in vitro and in vivo. As such, we

predict that quiescence depth in vivo is also continuous instead
of binary. It is possible that different levels of injuries can cause
varying levels of quiescent states in vivo, which was not examined

previously but would be interesting to test in future studies. Fi-

nally, in support of the continuous quiescence depth in vivo are
the earlier findings that in the liver after partial hepatectomy and

in the salivary gland after isoproterenol stimulation, cells in in-

creasingly older rats took an increasingly longer time to initiate
DNA synthesis, behaving like cells in increasing deeper quies-
cence (10, 75).

Quiescence is commonly believed to protect cells from irre-

versible arrest, such as senescence. Our work suggests that this
protection declines in long-term quiescent cells and the gradual
quiescence deepening likely represents a transition path from

cell proliferation to senescence. Relatedly, the same Rb and p53

pathways appear to underlie both quiescence and senescence
(76

–
79). Whether and how the lysosome
–
autophagy pathway

interacts with Rb and p53 pathways to regulate the transition

from deep quiescence to senescence, and whether such a tran-

sition is gradual following a continuum or abrupt as controlled by
an ultrasensitive or bistable switch-like mechanism (80, 81), re-

main significant unanswered questions (

SI Appendix
, Fig. S1
A
).

Cell Culture and Quiescence Induction.

REFs used in this study are from a single-

cell clone derived from REF52 cells and contain a stably integrated human

E2F1 promoter-driven destabilized EGFP (E2f-GFP) reporter, as previously

described [i.e., REF/E23 cells (25, 82)] unless otherwise noted. Cells were

passaged every 2 to 3 d and maintained at subconfluency in growth me-

dium: DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (BGS; GE

Healthcare, SH30541). To induce quiescence, cells were plated at

∼
50%

confluence in growth medium for a day, washed twice with DMEM, and

cultured in serum-starvation medium (DMEM containing 0.02% BGS) for the

indicated duration (

≥
2d).


Quiescence-Depth Assay.

To assess quiescence depth, cells were switched from

serum-starvation medium to serum-stimulation medium (DMEM containing

BGS at indicated concentrations) and harvested at indicated time points by

trypsinization. The cell fraction that reentered the cell cycle was quantified by

assessing the profile of EdU incorporation (and the profiles of E2f-GFP re-

porter and PI DNA staining when indicated). Quiescence depth is determined

by the serum threshold required to activate cells to reenter the cell cycle. At a

given serum concentration, a smaller percentage of deeper quiescent cells are

able to reenter the cell cycle by a given time than of shallower quiescent cells.
