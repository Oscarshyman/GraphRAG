In particular, we\n\nfound that lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal mass (in-\n\ndicated by the intensity of lysosomal staining and the number of\n\nlysosomes per cell) continuously increase as quiescence deepens;\n\nhowever, autophagy flux decreases. Lysosomes are hydrolytic\n\nenzyme-filled organelles in the cell that break down many types of\n\nbiomolecules; lysosomal function, primarily through processes of\n\nautophagy and endocytosis, has been shown to prevent irreversible\n\ncellular states, such as senescenc\ne, terminal differentiation, and\n\nSignificance\nReactivating sleep-like quiescent cells in the body (most nota-\n\nbly stem cells) to divide is fundamental to tissue homeostasis\n\nand regeneration. Like sleep having shallow and deep stages,\nquiescence exhibits graded depths with different speeds and\nrates responding to stimulation signals. Understanding how\n\nquiescence depth is regulated is fundamental to our under-\n\nstanding of tissue repair and regeneration. Here we show that\nquiescence depth is regulated like a\n\n“\ndimmer switch\n”\nby lyso-\n\nsomes (cell organelles that break down and recycle biomole-\n\ncules), through the lysosomal function of reducing oxidative\nstress. We developed a gene signature to predict quiescence\ndepth and show that quiescence deepening likely represents a\n\ntransition path from cell division to irreversibly arrested se-\n\nnescence, related to the aging process.\n\nAuthor contributions: K.F., R.L., J.X., F.B., and G.Y. designed research; K.F., R.L., H.C., and\n\nK.D.C. performed research; K.F., R.L., H.C., K.D.C., H.H.Z., J.X., F.B., and G.Y. analyzed\ndata; and K.F., F.B., and G.Y. wrote the paper.\n\nThe authors declare no competing interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\nPublished under the\nPNAS license.\n\nData deposition: The data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Gene Ex-\n\npression Omnibus (GEO) database,\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo(accession no.\n\nGSE124109\n).\n1K.F. and R.L. contributed equally to this work.\n2To whom correspondence may be addressed.

Here we found that the increased lysosomal mass\n\nin deep quiescent cells is, in part, due to decreased autophagy flux,\n\nwhich is partially but not fully compensated by increased lysosomal\n\ngene expression and lysosomal biogenesis. We show that lysosomal\nfunction, like a dimmer switch, cont\ninuously regulates quiescence\n\ndepth and thus the proliferative potential of quiescent cells by re-\n\nducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We\n\nfound that a set of\n\n“\nsenescence core signature\n”\ngenes (19) show\n\nsimilar expression patterns in deep quiescence as in senescence, and\nthat a gene-expression signature w\ne developed to indicate cellular\n\nquiescence depth by comparing deep and shallow quiescent REF\n\ncells is able to correctly classify senescent and aging cells in a wide\narray of cell lines in vitro (20, 21) and tissues in vivo (22, 23),\n\nsuggesting that deep quiescence may serve as a common transition\n\npath from cell proliferation to senescence, related to aging.\n\n\nResults\nDynamic Transcriptome Changes during Quiescence Deepening.\nSimilar\n\nto our previous observation (14), REF cells moved into deeper\nquiescence progressively with longer-term serum starvation. After\n2-d serum starvation, the entire cell population entered quiescence, as\n\ndemonstrated by their negative D\nNA incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2\n′\n-\n\ndeoxyuridine (EdU) and a complete shut-off of E2f1 expression (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S1\n B\n). E2f1 is a member of the E2f family of tran-\n\nscription factors; it up-regulates a large battery of genes involved in\n\nDNA replication and cell cycle progression, acting as the key ef-\n\nfector of an Rb-E2f bistable switch that controls the all-or-none\ntransition from quiescence to proliferation (24, 25). With in-\n\ncreasingly longer serum starvati\non, cells moved into deeper quies-\n\ncence, requiring a longer time and a greater serum stimulation\nstrength (concentration) to reen\nter the cell cycle than cells in\n\nshallower quiescence. For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosomal function involves the breakdown and recycling of biomolecules, playing a crucial role in regulating cellular quiescence and preventing irreversible states such as senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can be activated under certain conditions, exhibiting graded depths influenced by various factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELLULAR SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Cellular senescence is a state where cells cease to divide and can contribute to aging and tissue dysfunction, often linked to quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGING<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Aging is the process of becoming older, characterized by a gradual decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REF CELLS<|>CELL TYPE<|>REF cells are a type of cell used in research to study quiescence and cellular responses to various stimuli, particularly in the context of serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>GENE<|>Lysosomal gene expression refers to the expression of genes involved in the formation and function of lysosomes, which increase as quiescence deepens.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL MASS<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosomal mass indicates the quantity of lysosomes within a cell, which increases as cells enter deeper states of quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOPHAGY FLUX<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Autophagy flux is the process by which cells degrade and recycle cellular components, which decreases as quiescence deepens.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>FACTOR<|>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen that can cause cellular damage; their accumulation is reduced by lysosomal function.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>5-ETHYNYL-2'-DEOXYURIDINE (EDU)<|>FACTOR<|>5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) is a nucleoside analog used to measure cell proliferation by detecting newly synthesized DNA.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E2F1<|>GENE<|>E2F1 is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, playing a key role in the transition from quiescence to proliferation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal function regulates quiescence depth by managing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and influencing cellular dormancy<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CELLULAR SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence is linked to cellular senescence, as both processes involve changes in cell cycle activity and can influence aging<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELLULAR SENESCENCE<|>AGING<|>Cellular senescence contributes to the aging process by promoting tissue dysfunction and limiting regenerative capacity<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>REF cells are used to study the mechanisms of quiescence and how it can be influenced by various factors<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>LYSOSOMAL MASS<|>Increased lysosomal gene expression contributes to the accumulation of lysosomal mass in deep quiescent cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTOPHAGY FLUX<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>Decreased autophagy flux is associated with increased lysosomal function in deep quiescent cells<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL FUNCTION<|>REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS)<|>Lysosomal function helps reduce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which can damage cells<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>5-ETHYNYL-2'-DEOXYURIDINE (EDU)<|>EdU incorporation is used to assess the quiescent state of REF cells by measuring their DNA synthesis<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>E2F1<|>QUIESCENCE<|>E2F1 is involved in regulating the transition from quiescence to proliferation, influencing cell cycle progression<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
