Furthermore, the transcriptomic proﬁle changes during qui-\nescence deepening in REFs resemble those of senescence entry with similar expression\nchanges in “senescence core signature” genes [16,49]. A gene signature derived from\nquiescence deepening in REFs, the quiescence depth score (QDS), can correctly predict a\nwide array of senescent and aging cell types [16,50]. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that\nquiescence deepening represents a continuum transition trajectory from proliferation to\nsenescence, which is a model increasingly recognized in the ﬁeld [9,51–55].\nSupporting the quiescence–senescence continuum concept, the levels of multiple\nwidely used senescence biomarkers (e.g., SA-β-gal, LAMP1, IL8, 53BP1, p21, Lamin B1, and\ncell size) were found to increase gradually with the duration of cell-cycle withdrawal and\ncannot distinguish senescence from deep quiescence [56]. This quiescence–senescence con-\ntinuum could help explain some normal physiological functions of cellular senescence [57],\nas some of the senescent cells identiﬁed based on biomarker intensities may instead be\ndeep quiescent cells.\n3. Mechanisms Underlying Quiescence Deepening and Quiescence-Origin Senescence\nThe cellular processes underlying quiescence deepening and transition to senescence\nlikely involve a complex interplay between various cellular mechanisms and signaling\npathways. Yet, a converging theme has started to emerge from recent studies.\n3.1. Trigger: The Lysosome–Autophagy Axis\nThe lysosome–autophagy axis has emerged as a critical driver of quiescence deepening\nand transition to senescence across various cell types. Autophagy involves autophagosomes\nengulﬁng cellular components and fusing with lysosomes, where lysosomal enzymes\ndegrade the contents and recycle the macromolecules. This lysosome–autophagy activity\nacts as a “dimmer switch” regulating quiescence depth in REFs with its continuously\ndecreased activity leading to progressively deeper quiescence toward senescence [16]. It\nalso underlies the quiescence-to-senescence transition in geriatric MuSCs [18].\nIn both REFs and geriatric MuSCs, ROS accumulation serves as a key effector of the im-\npaired lysosomal autophagy function [16,18]. In REFs, ROS accumulation, without evoking\np16INK4a, leads to quiescence deepening [16]; in MuSCs, ROS accumulation epigenetically\nderepresses the p16INK4alocus and leads to the quiescence-to-senescence transition [18].\nSimilarly, ROS accumulation drives the quiescence-to-senescence transition in HSPCs by\nelevating the p16INK4alevel [14].\nIn neural stem cells (NSCs), the lysosome–autophagy axis, with increased protein\naggregates as the main effector, plays a crucial role in quiescence deepening. Aging\nquiescent NSCs display lysosomal defects, increased protein aggregates, and diminished\nactivation potential [58].\nEnhancing lysosomal autophagy in various cell types, including REFs, MuSCs, and\nNSCs, promotes shallow quiescence away from the transition to senescence [16,18,58].Biomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 4 of 8\n\nTogether, the ﬁndings above highlight the lysosome–autophagy axis as a central trigger of\nquiescence deepening and the quiescence-to-senescence transition.\n3.2. Controller: The Rb–E2F Switch Threshold\nOur earlier studies demonstrated that the Rb–E2F pathway, a pivotal regulator of the\ncell cycle in animals and plants [59–63], functions as a bistable toggle switch [64,65]. This\nRb–E2Fswitch converts graded and transient mitogen signals into a binary (OFF/ON)\nactivity of E2F (representing the combined E2F transcriptional activators, E2F1-3a), which\nunderlies the all-or-none quiescence-to-proliferation transition [27,64,65]. The activation\nthreshold of the Rb–E2F switch, “Rb–E2F switch threshold” for short, controls quies-\ncence depth: increasing or decreasing this threshold drives cells to deeper and shallower\nquiescence, respectively [27,28,66]. The Rb–E2F switch threshold is deﬁned as the min-\nimum growth stimulus required to activate the cellular E2F level to exceed that of non-\nphosphorylated Rb, which binds to and inhibits E2F in quiescent cells [27,28,66]. We have\nshown that the Rb–E2F switch threshold can be modulated by multiple factors in the\nRb–E2F pathway with varying degrees of sensitivity with those associated with G1 cyclins\nand cyclin-dependent kinases (\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUESCENCE DEEPENING<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence deepening refers to the process where cells transition from a reversible quiescent state to an irreversible senescent state, influenced by various cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Senescence is a state where cells cease to divide and can contribute to aging and tissue dysfunction, often characterized by specific biomarkers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY ACTIVITY<|>FACTOR<|>Lysosomal autophagy activity is a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, playing a critical role in regulating quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFS<|>CELL TYPE<|>REFs are a type of cell used in research to study quiescence and senescence, particularly in the context of lysosomal function and autophagy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>GENE<|>The quiescence depth score (QDS) is a gene signature derived from quiescence deepening in REFs that can predict various senescent and aging cell types.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENESCENCE CORE SIGNATURE GENES<|>GENE<|>Senescence core signature genes are a set of genes whose expression changes are associated with the entry into senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROS ACCUMULATION<|>FACTOR<|>ROS accumulation refers to the buildup of reactive oxygen species in cells, which can influence cellular processes such as quiescence and senescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEURAL STEM CELLS (NSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Neural stem cells (NSCs) are a type of stem cell that can differentiate into various neural cell types and are involved in processes of quiescence and aging.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERIATRIC MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>CELL TYPE<|>Geriatric muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are muscle stem cells that exhibit changes in quiescence and senescence with aging.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB–E2F PATHWAY<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>The Rb–E2F pathway is a critical regulator of the cell cycle that functions as a bistable toggle switch controlling the transition between quiescence and proliferation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB–E2F SWITCH THRESHOLD<|>FACTOR<|>The Rb–E2F switch threshold is the minimum growth stimulus required to activate E2F levels, influencing quiescence depth in cells.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY ACTIVITY<|>QUESCENCE DEEPENING<|>Lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a \"dimmer switch\" that regulates the depth of quiescence, influencing the transition to senescence.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUESCENCE DEEPENING<|>SENESCENCE<|>Quiescence deepening represents a continuum transition trajectory leading to senescence, indicating a close relationship between the two processes.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REFS<|>LYSOSOMAL AUTOPHAGY ACTIVITY<|>REFs are used to study the effects of lysosomal autophagy activity on quiescence and senescence transitions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUESCENCE DEPTH SCORE (QDS)<|>SENESCENCE<|>The quiescence depth score (QDS) can predict various senescent and aging cell types, linking quiescence deepening to senescence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENESCENCE CORE SIGNATURE GENES<|>SENESCENCE<|>Changes in the expression of senescence core signature genes are associated with the entry into senescence, indicating their role in this process.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROS ACCUMULATION<|>QUESCENCE DEEPENING<|>ROS accumulation serves as a key effector in the transition from quiescence deepening to senescence in various cell types.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEURAL STEM CELLS (NSCs)<|>QUESCENCE DEEPENING<|>NSCs display lysosomal defects and increased protein aggregates, which are linked to quiescence deepening and aging.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GERIATRIC MUSCLE STEM CELLS (MuSCs)<|>QUESCENCE DEEPENING<|>Geriatric MuSCs exhibit a transition from quiescence to senescence influenced by lysosomal autophagy activity.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RB–E2F PATHWAY<|>RB–E2F SWITCH THRESHOLD<|>The Rb–E2F pathway regulates the Rb–E2F switch threshold, which controls quiescence depth and the transition to proliferation.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
