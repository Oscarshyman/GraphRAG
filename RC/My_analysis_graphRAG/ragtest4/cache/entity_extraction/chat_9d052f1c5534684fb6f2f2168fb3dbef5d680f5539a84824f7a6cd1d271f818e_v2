It is\n\nunclear what resulted in declined autophagy in deep quiescence\ndespite increased lysosomal gene expression (Fig. 2\n\nE\n) and bio-\n\ngenesis. Note that not every lysosomal gene increased expression\n\nwith quiescence deepening: A small subset of lysosomal genes\nenriched for those that also function in the Golgi network\nshowed a general decrease (see cluster B in Fig. 2\n\nE\nfor enrich-\n\nment analysis and\n\nSI Appendix\n, Table S2). As the Golgi network\n\nis critical to transporting lysosomal hydrolases from cytoplasmic\nribosomes into lysosomal vesicles (52), the reduced expression of\n\nsome of these related genes, therefore, may lead to a reduced\n\nlysosomal\n\n–\nautophagy function. Alternatively, the\n“\nnet\n”\ndecrease\n\nin lysosomal function may be adaptive and serve as a cellular\ncounter for serum-deprivation duration (i.e., environmental\n\ngrowth restriction), which in turn determines how cautious the\n\ncell will get before resuming growth. The exact mechanisms\ndictating the relationship between lysosomal function and qui-\nescence depth awaits further studies.\n\nOur results suggest that lysosomal function prevents quies-\n\ncence deepening via ROS reduction (Fig. 6). Previous studies\nhave shown that the lysosome\n\n–\nautophagy pathway reduces ROS\n\nin several types of quiescent cells (15, 16) through mitophagy:\n\nThat is, selective autophagic degradation of damaged mito-\n\nchondria (15). It remains to be tested whether lysosomes prevent\nquiescence deepening in REF cells via mitophagy, but the re-\n\nduced mitochondrial ROS levels resulting from enhanced lyso-\n\nsomal function (Fig. 6\n\nE\nand\nF\n) is consistent with this model.\n\nIt was shown previously that mTORC1 can transform muscle\nstem cells into a shallower quiescent state, called GAlert, in which\n\ncells are sensitized to growth stimulation (8). Consistently, con-\n\ntinuous mTORC1 activation led to depletion of certain types of\nquiescent stem cells in vivo by forcing cell cycle reentry (53, 54).\n\nIt is well established that mTORC1 drives cell growth and in-\n\nhibits the lysosome-autophagy pathway (43, 55). Accordingly, the\n\neffect of mTORC1 on quiescence depth is likely 2-sided: By\npromoting cell growth, mTORC1 facilitates quiescence exit and\nthus reduces quiescence depth; by inhibiting lysosomal function,\n\nmTORC1 drives cells deeper into quiescence. In the GAlertcase,\n\nwhere mTORC1 is activated both before and during stimulation,\nthe net result appears to be shallower quiescence. The exact\nbimodal effects of mTORC1 on quiescence depth may be com-\n\nplicated and condition-dependent, awaiting future studies.\n\nThe lysosome\n\n–\nautophagy pathway plays an important role in\n\ncancer physiology and dormancy (5, 40, 41, 56\n\n–\n58). Activities of\n\nMiT/TFE family members, including Tfeb and Mitf, are up-regulated\n\nby overexpression or nuclear localization in multiple cancer types,\nincluding lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers (41, 59, 60), which is\nlinked to poor prognosis and survival (59, 60). The lysosome\n\n–\nauto-\n\nphagy pathway appears to help mai\nntain dormant cancer cells and\n\nfacilitate survival and metastasis (5). Consistently, autophagy in-\nhibition decreases the viability of dormant breast cancer cells and\ntheir metastatic recurrence, suggesting a promising treatment\n\nstrategy (57). Future studies are needed to determine the op-\n\ntimal target and degree of lysosomal\n\n–\nautophagy inhibition in treat-\n\nment to minimize disrupting the qu\niescence depth of normal cells.\n\nOur study highlights that deep quiescent cells exhibit gene-\n\nexpression signatures that are similar to senescent and aged cells\n\n(Fig. 7\n\nB\n–\nE\n). The enriched up-regulation of lysosomal genes\n\n(KEGG_lysosome gene set) is shown in 10 of the 11 studied\n\naging tissues (adrenal gland, br\nain, heart, kidney, liver, lung,\n\nspleen, thymus, uterus, testis,\nbut not muscle); it is also shown\n\nin 5 of the 6 cell lines (BJ, IMR-90, WI-38, HFF, MRC-5, but\nnot MDAH041) studied under replicative senescence, but not\n\nshown in stress (Adriamycin/5-aza/H2O2)-induced senescence in\n\nMDAH041 cells (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Table S4). This result is consistent\n\nwith the findings that senescence and aging are partially driven\nby ROS and can be counteracted by lysosome\n\n–\nautophagy activ-\n\nities in many but not all conditions (6, 15, 17, 61\n\n–\n63), indicating\n\nthe contributions of other potentially shared mechanisms un-\nderlying deep quiescence, senescence, and aging. Among them,\nDNA damage is a likely candidate, which can be caused by\n\nvarious stress signals (e\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
