Speci/uniFB01cally, cells inmicro/uniFB02uidic devices were cultured in serum-starvation medium(0.02% serum) for 4 days under an extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow (0, 5, or20/uni03BCl/h); serum-starvation medium was then replaced by serum-stimulation medium (1–4% serum) using a pipette—this mediumchange procedure in each micro/uniFB02uidic device was completedwithin 1 min (compared to otherwise more than 20 and 5 h undera pump-driven slow/uniFB02ow of 5 and 20/uni03BCl/h, respectively); cells werethen cultured in static medium during serum stimulation.

These results suggest that a higher extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate leads to shallower quiescence, from which cells are morelikely to reenter the cell cycle upon stimulation.\nMechanical Shear Stress Drives ShallowQuiescence\nFluid/uniFB02ow introduces two types of cues to cells: 1) hydrodynamicshear stress (physical cue), and 2) continuous replenishment ofnutrients and other compounds dissolved in the/uniFB02uid andremoval of local cell-secreted substances (collectively asextracellular factor replacement; biochemical cue). Todetermine whether these physical and biochemical cues actagonistically or antagonistically (thereby potentiating orattenuating the combined effect) in affecting cellularquiescence depth, we next conducted experiments to delineatethe effect of each of the two cues.To isolate the effect of mechanical shear stress from that ofextracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth, theviscosity of the culture medium was varied while its/uniFB02ow rate (andthus the pace of extracellular/uniFB02uid replacement) was maintainedat a constant level. The/uniFB02ow-induced shear stress is linearlyproportional to the viscosity of working/uniFB02uid (Eq. 1), whichcan be manipulated by varying the amount of high-molecular-weight dextran dissolved in the medium (Table 1).Accordingly, REF/E23 cells were/uniFB01rst induced to quiescence byculturing them in the serum-starvation medium containing 0, 25,50, or 100 mg/ml high molecular weight ( ~ 500,000) dextran,respectively, for 4 days under 5 or 20/uni03BCl/h/uniFB02ow rate. The cells werethen stimulated with 2% or 4% serum for 26 h, and the fraction ofcells that exited quiescence (E2f-On%) was measured. As showninFigures 4A,B, E2f-On% increased with increasing dextranconcentration in the serum-starvation medium under either 5 or20/uni03BCl/h/uniFB02ow rate. By contrast, cells cultured in static serum-starvation medium containing the same higher dextranconcentration entered deeper rather than shallower quiescence(Supplementary Figure S2; see Discussion).
