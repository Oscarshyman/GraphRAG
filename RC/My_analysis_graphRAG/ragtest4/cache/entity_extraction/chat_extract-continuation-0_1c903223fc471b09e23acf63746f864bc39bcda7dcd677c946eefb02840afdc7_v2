Together, our modeling andexperimental results suggest that the/uniFB02ow-induced shear stress(physical cue) and replacement of extracellular factors(biochemical cues) contribute agnostically to the effect ofextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow in promoting quiescence exit bylowering the activation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.The good agreement between simulations and experimentsmotivated the application of the model for predicting the cellresponses to higher/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rates above 20 ul/h, under whichcells started to partially detach from the microchannel bottomsurface and hence excluded from the current experimental study.The simulation results show that the additive effect ofextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow to a given serum signal on quiescenceexit (E2f-On%) can be well/uniFB01tted with a Hill function (Figure 6C).Namely, E2f-On% increases monotonically with increasing/uniFB02owrate but is asymptotically bound by a serum concentration-dependent level. By contrast, with suf/uniFB01ciently high serumconcentration, the entire cell population can exit quiescence(i.e., E2f-On% approaches 100%) in our model even withoutextracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow (Figure 6D). This latter result is consistentwith what we experimentally observed previously in REF/E23cells under static medium (Yao et al., 2008;Kwon et al., 2017;Fujimaki et al., 2019). Therefore, it appears that extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow facilitates quiescence exit by reducing the E2f-activationserum threshold, but unlikely to fully replace the role of serumgrowth factors in this process.\nDISCUSSION\nQuiescence is a reversible cellular dormancy state that canpersist over prolonged periods of time. The on-demandreactivation of quiescent cells to divide serves as the basisfor tissue homeostasis and repair (Coller et al., 2006;Wilsonet al., 2008;Cheung and Rando, 2013).
