The microenvironmentexperienced by cultured cells under static medium,however, is different from that experienced by tissue cellsin vivowhere they are exposed to continuous interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ows. The interstitial/uniFB02ow exerts hydrodynamic shear stresson cells due to/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow viscosity and shear strain rate; the/uniFB02ow also carries fresh nutrients along with dissolvedcompounds and removes local substances secreted by cells(Jain, 1987;Wiig, 1990;Wang and Tarbell, 1995;Ng andSwartz, 2003;Swartz and Fleury, 2007;Shi and Tarbell, 2011;Freund et al., 2012;Galie et al., 2012). As such, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow is known to play a critical role in repairing andremolding tissues, such as the vascular, lung, and bone(Hillsley and Frangos, 1994;Liu et al., 1999;Louis et al.,2006;Rensen et al., 2007), through affecting cell morphology,adhesion, motility, metabolism, and differentiation(Yamamoto et al., 2005;Lutolf et al., 2009;Toh andVoldman, 2011;Hyler et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019).However, whether and how extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow affectscellular quiescence remains unclear.In this study, a micro/uniFB02uidic platform is designed to mimic thephysiologically relevant interstitial/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow with varying rates(Figure 1) and investigate the/uniFB02ow effects on cellular quiescence.Experimental parameters, including/uniFB02ow rate,/uniFB02uid viscosity, and/uniFB02ow volume, were varied to test the effects of/uniFB02ow rate, shear stress,and extracellular factor replacement on cellular quiescence depth.Our results show that,/uniFB01rst, several quiescence characteristicsidenti/uniFB01ed previously under static medium are also present undercontinuous/uniFB02\nuid/uniFB02ow, including the serum signal-dependantquiescence entry and exit and the time-dependant quiescencedeepening (Figure 2). Second, extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow sensitizescells to serum growth signals and thus leads to shallowquiescence. Particularly, increasing the/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate reducesthe serum level needed for quiescence exit and cell cycle reentry.This result is likely due to the extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow lowering theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch that controlsthe quiescence-to-proliferation transition (Yao et al., 2008;Kwonet al., 2017), as suggested by our model simulations (Figure 6). Ahigher/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow rate entails higher mechanical shear stress and afaster pace of extracellular factor replacement. These physical andbiochemical cues are able to drive cells into shallow quiescencewhen present either together (Figure 3) or separately (Figures 4,5). As a result, exposed to a faster extracellular/uniFB02uid/uniFB02ow, cellsbecome more sensitive to serum growth signals and more likely toreenter the cell cycle.Several questions are left unanswered in our study. First, themolecular mechanisms are to be identi/uniFB01ed by which/uniFB02ow-inducedshear stress and extracellular factor replacement lower theactivation threshold of the Rb-E2f bistable switch.Interestingly, increasing medium viscosity (by a higher dextranconcentration) promotes quiescence exit under a medium/uniFB02ow(Figure 4), but it inhibits quiescence exit in static medium(Supplementary Figure S2). This result may be associatedwith medium viscosity-induced changes in certain lipoproteinsynthesis (Yedgar et al., 1982), cytoskeleton and cell morphology(Khorshid, 2005), cell attachment and in/uniFB02ammation (\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY<|>RESEARCH ARTICLE<|>A research article published in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology in February 2022 discussing the effects of extracellular flow on cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIU ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Liu et al. are researchers who studied the effects of extracellular flow on cellular quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLOW<|>FACTOR<|>Extracellular flow refers to the movement of interstitial fluid that can influence cellular behavior, including quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence is a state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can be activated under certain conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERUM DEPRIVATION<|>FACTOR<|>Serum deprivation is a method used to induce quiescence in cells by removing growth factors present in serum.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTACT INHIBITION<|>FACTOR<|>Contact inhibition is a process where cell growth and division are halted when cells come into contact with each other.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOSS OF ADHESION<|>FACTOR<|>Loss of adhesion refers to the detachment of cells from their substrate, which can trigger quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RB-E2F BISTABLE SWITCH<|>FACTOR<|>The Rb-E2F bistable switch is a regulatory mechanism that controls the transition between quiescence and proliferation in cells.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEXTRAN<|>FACTOR<|>Dextran is a polysaccharide used to modify the viscosity of the medium in cell culture experiments.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLOW<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Extracellular flow influences cellular quiescence by affecting the sensitivity of cells to serum growth signals, leading to shallow quiescence.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIU ET AL.<|>FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY<|>Liu et al. authored a research article discussing the effects of extracellular flow on cellular quiescence in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SERUM DEPRIVATION<|>Serum deprivation is one of the methods used to induce quiescence in cells, highlighting its role in cellular dormancy.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>CONTACT INHIBITION<|>Contact inhibition is another mechanism that can lead to quiescence, as it stops cell division upon cell-cell contact.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>LOSS OF ADHESION<|>Loss of adhesion can trigger quiescence in cells, indicating a relationship between cell attachment and dormancy.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTRACELLULAR FLOW<|>RB-E2F BISTABLE SWITCH<|>Extracellular flow affects the Rb-E2F bistable switch, lowering the activation threshold for the quiescence-to-proliferation transition.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEXTRAN<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Increasing medium viscosity with dextran can promote quiescence exit under flow conditions, showing its impact on cellular behavior.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
