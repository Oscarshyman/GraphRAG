The inner surfaces of the microchannel werecoated with 2% (w/w)/uniFB01bronectin to enhance the adhesion of cellsto the bottom surface.\nFlow Rate and Flow-Induced Shear Stress\nThe total volume of medium in a microdevice (including tubingat the inlet/outlet of the channel but not connectors,Figure 1C)isapproximately 140/uni03BCl, and the medium volume in themicro/uniFB02uidic channel alone is about 67 µl. In this study, acontinuous medium/uniFB02ow with a/uniFB01xed/uniFB02ow rate (5 or 20/uni03BCl/h)was fed into the channel to mimic the typical interstitial/uniFB02owvelocity in soft tissues (Swartz and Fleury, 2007) unless otherwisenoted. Correspondingly, the/uniFB02ow rate, rather than the primingvolume, is used to characterize the/uniFB02ow effect. We also considerthe concentration of the bulk/uniFB02uid is uniform spatially, and localdiffusion and convection at the interfaces between the/uniFB02uid andcells can be neglected.Pressure-driven/uniFB02ow in a microchannel presents a non-uniform velocity pro/uniFB01le, which gives rise to shear stress.
