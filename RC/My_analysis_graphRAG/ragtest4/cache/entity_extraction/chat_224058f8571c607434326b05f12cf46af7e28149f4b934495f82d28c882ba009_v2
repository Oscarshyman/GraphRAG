Remarkably, the expression of Mitf and Tfe3 but not Tfeb\n\nincreased significantly in deep quiescence (Fig. 5\n\nA\n)(\nP\n=\n0.028, 0.032,\n\nand 0.827 for Mitf, Tfe3, and Tf\neb, respectively, in a 1-tailed\nt\ntest\n\ncomparing 16-d and 2-d serum-sta\nrved cells); meanwhile, Mitf but\n\nnot Tfeb and Tfe3 showed a high degree of coexpression with lyso-\n\nsomal genes in quiescence (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S6\n C\n). Together, these\n\nresults suggested a unique role for Mitf in regulating lysosomal\nfunction in the quiescent REF cell model. Indeed, we found that\nectopic Mitf expression in quiescent REF cells (arrow in\n\nSI Appendix\n,\n\nFig. S6\n\nD\n) significantly increased both the LysoTracker intensity (\nP\n=\n\n\n0.017 in a 1-tailed\n\nt\ntest) (Fig. 5\nB\nand\nC\n) and lysosomal number (\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S6\n E\n) in the cell, as well as enhanced autophagy flux\n\n(higher LC3-II\n\n/uni0394\n)(Fig.5\n D\n), demonstrating the ability of Mitf to\n\nincrease lysosomal biogenesis and fu\nnction. Consistently, ectopic Mitf\n\nexpression pushed cells into shallower quiescence, as seen in both a\n\nhigher EdU\n+\n% upon serum stimulation (Fig. 5\n\nE\n) and a shorter time\n\nto reenter the cell cycle (Fig. 5\n\nF\n). Notably, there was a monotonic\n\ncorrelation between the level of i\nntroduced Mitf expression vector\n\n(indicated by mCherry intensity) (\n\nx\naxis in Fig. 5\nG\n) and the\nEdU\n+\nlevel upon serum stimulation (normalized to mCherry con-\n\ntrol) (\n\ny\naxis in Fig. 5\nG\n), suggesting that cells can be continuously\n\ndriven to shallower quiescence by enhancing lysosomal function.\n\nLysosomal Function Prevents Quiescence Deepening via ROS Reduction.\n\nLysosomes are\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
