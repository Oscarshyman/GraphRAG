The Quiescence–Senescence Continuum: A Framework for Understanding\nQuiescence-Origin Senescence\n2.1. Direct Transition from Quiescence to Senescence\nMounting evidence in the past decade demonstrates a direct transition to senescence in\nquiescent cells under stress or with aging. One of the ﬁrst reports of this phenomenon was\nin geriatric mice, where quiescent satellite cells (muscle stem cells, MuSCs) lose regenerative\ncapacity and become irreversibly arrested [13]. The same observation was conﬁrmed in\ngeriatric human muscle, suggesting a conserved mechanism contributing to age-related\ndecline in muscle regenerative capacity [13]. The quiescence-to-senescence transition in\ngeriatric MuSCs was linked to the epigenetic derepression of p16INK4a, which is a key\nregulator of senescence [13].\nFurther research revealed that p16INK4aderepression in geriatric MuSCs was triggered\nby accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from failed autophagy [18]. Restor-\ning autophagy prevents the transition to senescence in quiescent MuSCs [18]. Similarly,\nin quiescent human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), stress-induced ROS\naccumulation can elevate the p16 INK4alevel and drive the transition to senescence [14].\nIn vitrostudies provide further evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence tran-\nsition. Long-term quiescent human ﬁbroblasts in culture (100–150 days) accumulate DNA\ndamage and transit into senescence [15]. Our recent work showed that quiescent rat\nembryonic ﬁbroblasts (REFs) with impaired lysosomal autophagy can directly enter a\nsenescence-like state characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest,β-galactosidase activity,\nand cellular hypertrophy [16]. Thesein vitroresults strengthen the ﬁndings ofin vivo\nstudies by showing that cells maintained in quiescent conditions throughout the experi-\nments eventually transitioned to senescence, bypassing cell proliferation (which can be\ndifﬁcult to trackin vivo, e.g., throughout the entire geriatric phase). Together, thesein vivo\nandin vitrostudies provide compelling evidence for the direct quiescence-to-senescence\ntransition, resulting in quiescence-origin senescence.\n2.2. Quiescence Deepening into Senescence: A Continuum Model\nThe observation that cells can transition from quiescence to senescence aligns with the\nconcept that quiescence is not a uniform state but rather a spectrum of dormant depths.\nSpeciﬁcally, deeper quiescent cells are more resistant to cell cycle re-entry, and they resume\nproliferation less frequently or with a longer delay than shallower quiescent cells given the\nsame growth stimulation [8,19–35]. Cells in deep quiescence generally exhibit decreased\ntranscription, reduced RNA and protein levels, and increased chromatin condensation\ncompared to cells in shallow quiescence [22,36–38]. Recent studies have further revealed the\nchanges in the cellular proﬁles of gene expression, epigenetic modiﬁcation, and metabolism\nthat occur during the process of quiescence deepening [8,16,39–41]. It is important to note\nthat deep quiescent cells, by deﬁnition, still retain the potential for cell cycle re-entry and\ncan resume proliferation given a sufﬁciently strong and sustained growth stimulus, which\nis distinct from senescent cells.\nQuiescence deepening has been observed under extended quiescence in culture or\nalong the aging processin vivoacross mammalian cell types and tissues [8,19–33] as wellBiomedicines2024,12, 1837\n 3 of 8\n\nas in yeast [34] and C. elegans [35]. Consistent with quiescence depth being a continuum,\nsubpopulations of quiescent muscle, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, upon tissue\ninjury or in response to systemic factors, can move to shallower (primed or GAlert) qui-\nescence, bearing a closer resemblance to active cells [42–45]. Further extending the cell\ndormancy state continuum, senescent cells also exhibit varying “depths” with different\ncellular characteristics [46–48].\nOur recent work directly links quiescence deepening to senescence entry. We found\nthat while enhancing lysosomal autophagy activity pushes REFs toward shallow quiescence,\ndecreasing lysosomal autophagy drives REFs into progressively deeper quiescence [16].\nWhen lysosomal autophagy is severely hampered (with chloroquine treatment, for exam-\nple), deep quiescent (yet still reversible) cells transition into irreversible senescence [16].\nThis suggests that lysosomal autophagy activity acts as a “dimmer switch” that continu-\nously adjusts cellular dormancy depth from shallow quiescence to deep quiescence and\nﬁnally to senescence [16,41]. Furthermore, the transcriptomic proﬁle changes during qui-\nescence\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
