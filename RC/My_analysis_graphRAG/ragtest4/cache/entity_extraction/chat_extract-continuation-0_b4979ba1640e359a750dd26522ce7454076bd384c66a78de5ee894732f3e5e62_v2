For example, when the duration of serum\n\nstarvation increased gradually fr\nom 2 to 14 d, the cell cycle reentry\n\ntime upon 20% serum stimulation increased from\n\n<\n19 h to\n∼\n25 h\n\n(to achieve\n\n∼\n60% EdU\n+\nrate) (Fig. 1\nA\nand\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S1\n C\n),\n\nand the serum concentration req\nuired for cell cycle reentry in-\n\ncreased from\n\n<\n2% to\n∼\n8% (to achieve\n∼\n60% EdU\n+\nmeasured at\n\nthe 25th hour of serum stimulation) (Fig. 1\n\nB\n). This result is con-\n\nsistent with our earlier findings that the time and serum threshold\nrequired for cell cycle reentry are 2\nrelated features that both reflect\n\nthe same biological state, the quiescence depth (14). Importantly,\n\ndeep quiescent cells were not irre\nversibly arrested. For example,\n\nupon 20% serum stimulation, 92.\n6% of 16-d serum-starved deep\n\nquiescent REF cells were able to reenter the cell cycle (EdU\n+\n)\n\nwithin 41 h (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S1\n B\n).\n\nTo identify molecular mechanisms regulating quiescence\ndepth at the transcriptional level, we performed RNA-sequencing\n\n(RNA-seq) analysis of 0- to 16-d serum-starved cells (26). As\n\nexpected, the expression of well-characterized proliferation\ngenes\n\n—\nsuch as E2f1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 (\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n A\n)\n—\n\n\nE2f1 target genes (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n B\n), and proliferation-\n\nrelated gene clusters (#7 and 9,\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n C\n)was\n\nquickly down-regulated within 2-d serum starvation. Conversely,\nthe expression of growth inhibitory genes, such as Rb1, Cdkn1a\n(p21Cip1), and Cdkn1b (p27Kip1), was up-regulated upon se-\n\nrum starvation (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S2\n A\n). The expression of Cdkn2a\n\n(p16INK4A), a senescence marker (27), remained low as cells\nmoved deeper in quiescence (3- to 16-d serum starvation) (\n\nSI\n\nAppendix\n\n,Fig.S2\n D\n), consistent with quiescence being a\n\nreversible state.\n\nThe global gene-expression profile changed drastically when\ncells transitioned from proliferation to quiescence (0- to 2-d\n\nserum starvation) and continued to change sequentially as cells\n\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (2- to 16-d serum star-\nvation) (Fig. 1\n\nC\n). This sequential change was reflected in 9 gene\n\nclusters that exhibited different temporal dynamic patterns (Fig.\n\n2\n\nA\nand\nB\n). In particular, the expression of 2 gene clusters\n\nappeared to be positively correlated with quiescence deepening\nand increased monotonically as cells moved from shallow to\n\ndeep quiescence (clusters 1 and 3) (Fig. 2\n\nB\n). In cluster 1, mul-\n\ntiple biological functions were enriched; among them, lysosome\n\nwas overall the most statistically significant in Kyoto Encyclo-\n\npedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) overrepresentation tests\n\n[Fig. 2\n\nC\n, using clusterProfiler (28);\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n, using\n\nDAVID (29)]. In cluster 3, lysosome was the single function\n\nsignificantly enriched statistically (\n\nSI Appendix\n, Fig. S2\nC\n). Con-\n\nsistently, lysosomal genes also had the strongest positive corre-\n\nlation with deep quiescence in gene set enrichment analysis\n\n(GSEA) (30) (normalized enrichment score [NES]\n\n=\n3.12)\n\n(Fig. 2\n\nD\n).\n\nLysosomal Gene Expression and Lysosomal Mass Increase as Quiescence\n\nDeepens.\nThe vast majority of lysosomal genes, encoding for various\n\nlysosomal enzymes, activator proteins, membrane proteins, and ion\n\nchannel proteins, increased their expression continuously as cells\n\nmoved from shallow to deep quiescence (Fig. 2\n\nE\n[cluster C and the\n\nbottom half of cluster A], Fig. 2\n\nF\n,and\n SI Appendix\n,Fig.S3\n A\n). As a\n\ncomparison, the expression of most genes associated with endo-\n\nsomes, another cellular organelle in the endosomal\n\n–\nlysosomal sys-\n\ntem, only increased significantly during the first 2 d of serum\n\nstarvation but not afterward as quiescence continued to deepen\n(Fig. 2\n\nF\nand\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S3\n B\nand\nC\n).\n\nLysosomal mass also increased in deep quiescence: Following\n\na brief pulsatile adaptive response (within the first 6 h) upon\n\nserum starvation, lysosomal mass continuously increased over\n\nthe next 14 d, as seen from the stained LysoTracker intensity\n\n(Fig. 2\n\nG\n). The initial pulsatile response of lysosomal mass was\n\nlikely due to an adaptive mammalian target of rapamycin\n(mTOR)-autophagy response to serum starvation, as previously\n######################\noutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Quiescence refers to a state of cellular dormancy where cells are not actively dividing but can be activated under certain conditions, requiring specific stimuli to reenter the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REF CELLS<|>CELL TYPE<|>REF cells are a type of cell used in research to study quiescence and cellular responses to various stimuli, particularly in the context of serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDU INCORPORATION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>EdU incorporation is a method used to measure cell proliferation by detecting newly synthesized DNA in cells, indicating their ability to reenter the cell cycle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Serum starvation is a condition where cells are deprived of serum, leading to quiescence and affecting their ability to proliferate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosomal gene expression refers to the transcription of genes that encode lysosomal enzymes and proteins, which increase as cells transition from shallow to deep quiescence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYSOSOMAL MASS<|>BIOLOGICAL PROCESS<|>Lysosomal mass refers to the total amount of lysosomes within a cell, which increases during deep quiescence as a response to serum starvation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (mTOR)<|>FACTOR<|>mTOR is a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism, involved in the adaptive response to serum starvation and influencing lysosomal function.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>REF cells are used to study the mechanisms of quiescence and how they respond to serum starvation, affecting their ability to reenter the cell cycle.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUIESCENCE<|>SERUM STARVATION<|>Quiescence is induced by serum starvation, which leads to a state where cells are not actively dividing and require specific conditions to reactivate.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REF CELLS<|>EDU INCORPORATION<|>EdU incorporation is used to assess the percentage of REF cells that can reenter the cell cycle after serum starvation, indicating their quiescent state.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL GENE EXPRESSION<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal gene expression increases as cells transition from shallow to deep quiescence, indicating a change in cellular function during this state.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYSOSOMAL MASS<|>QUIESCENCE<|>Lysosomal mass increases during deep quiescence, reflecting the cellular adaptations to prolonged serum starvation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (mTOR)<|>LYSOSOMAL MASS<|>mTOR is involved in regulating lysosomal mass in response to serum starvation, influencing the cellular adaptation to quiescence.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
