The entry\n\n–\ndelay effect\n\nof Baf at the tested dose range was weaker than that of CQ:\nUnder strong serum stimulation (20%), the EdU\n+\npercentage of\n\ncells with either the treatment of 50 nM Baf or DMSO control did\n\nnot show a significant difference at either the 19th hour (Fig. 4\n\nE\n)\n\nor 24th hour (green arrow in Fig. 4\n\nB\n,\nLower\n); however, under\n\nreduced serum stimulation strength (6%) and longer observation\n\ntime window, the effect of Baf becomes clear in causing a delayed\n\nhalf-activation time of the quiescence-exit cell population com-\npared to the DMSO control (Fig. 4\n\nF\n).\n\nAs seen in Fig. 4\n\nB\n, a short but strong inhibition of lysosomal\n\nfunction by CQ treatment (6 h, 20\n\n/uni03BC\nM) deepened quiescence; the\n\nvast majority of cells were still EdU\n−\nat the 24th hour after 20%\n\nserum stimulation. However, these cells were reversible and\n\nbecame EdU\n+\nby the 48th hour (Fig. 4\n\nG\n). In comparison, a\n\nprolonged lysosomal inhibition by CQ treatment at a lower dose\n(54 h, 5\n\n/uni03BC\nM) drove a significant subpopulation of quiescent cells\n\ninto a more irreversible state: As seen in Fig. 4\n\nH\n, 41.4\n±\n2.9%\n\nsuch treated cells remained EdU\n−\nafter 48 h of 20% serum\n\nstimulation; in comparison,\n\n<\n2.5% of nontreated control cells\n\nremained EdU\n−\n(Fig. 4\n\nH\n). This result in quiescent cells may be\n\nrelated to earlier findings that a repeated or long exposure to\n\nsublethal stresses can effectively induce proliferating cells to\nsenescence (37, 38). In addition to the irreversible phenotype, we\nfound that long-term CQ exposed qu\niescent cells exhibited other\n\nhallmarks of senescence: A significantly increased\n\nβ\n-galactosidase\n\nactivity (\n\nP\n=\n0.011 in 1-tailed\nt\ntest) (Fig. 4\nI\n) and hypertrophy with a\n\nsignificantly increased cell size upon serum stimulation (\n\nP\n=\n0.003 in\n\n1-tailed\n\nt\ntest) (Fig. 4\nJ\n). Taken together, our data suggest that an\n\nimpairment of lysosomal function in quiescent cells can lead to deep\n\nquiescence and potentially a senescence-like state.\n\nEnhancing Lysosomal Function Pushes Cells toward Shallower Quiescence.\n\nIf the impaired lysosomal function is responsible for quiescence\n\ndeepening, enhancing such function will likely counteract this trend\n\nand push cells into shallower quiescence. Consistent with this hy-\n\npothesis, we observed that nutrient starvation, a known inducer of\nautophagy, pushed cells into shallo\nwer quiescence: Serum-starved\n\nREF cells treated with PBS (i.e., unde\nr additional nutrient starvation)\n\nfor 320 min showed significantly higher E2f-ON% (\n\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.\n\nS6\n\nA\n)andEdU\n +\n%(\nSI Appendix\n,Fig.S6\n B\n) upon serum stimulation\n\nthan treated with control (i.e., wit\nhout nutrient starvation). This re-\n\nsult is similar to what was previous\nly observed in quiescent neural\n\nstem cells (NSCs) (39). However, nut\nrient starvation induces a range\n\nof cellular responses (e.g., AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition)\nin addition to autophagy. To increa\nse lysosomal function directly, we\n\nsought to enhance lysosomal gene\nexpression and biogenesis in REF\n\ncells. Lysosomal gene expression and biogenesis can be up-regulated\n\nby a MiT/TFE family of transcript\nion factors Tfeb, Mitf, and Tfe3,\n\nwhich bind to a CLEAR-box sequence upstream of many lysosomal\ngenes and are known as the master re\ngulator of lysosome biogenesis\nA\n\nC\n BEF\n\nG\nD\n\nI\nH\n\nJ\n\nFig. 4.\n\nLysosomal inhibition pushes cells into deeper quiescence and senescent-like state.
