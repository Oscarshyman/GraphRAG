In 2006, it featured a research article that provided a novel description of cellular quiescence, shedding light on the mechanisms that govern this state of dormancy in cells. Following this, in 2010, another article explored stochastic E2F activation and developed models related to the cell cycle, enhancing the comprehension of how cells regulate their division and growth. More recently, in 2017, PLOS Biology published a study that mapped protein dynamics during cell-cycle progression and exit, offering insights into the intricate changes that proteins undergo as cells transition through different phases of the cell cycle. Collectively, these articles illustrate PLOS Biology's commitment to advancing knowledge in cellular biology and the dynamics of cell cycle regulation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191945, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 474, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
