This state is crucial for tissue homeostasis and repair, as it enables cells to persist without actively dividing. Quiescent cells can be activated under specific conditions, which may include factors such as nutrient availability, serum stimulation, and various signaling pathways. The depth of quiescence can vary and is influenced by multiple factors, including stress responses and lysosomal function. Quiescence has been extensively studied in various cell types, including WI-38 and 3T3 cells, highlighting its significance in cellular biology and its role in the broader context of tissue maintenance and regeneration.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191917, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 635, "total_tokens": 781, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
