Notably, a research article published in 2010 in Science explored the coexistence of quiescent and active adult stem cells, shedding light on the dynamics and functional roles of these distinct cellular states within adult tissues. This foundational work has implications for understanding tissue regeneration and repair mechanisms. Additionally, a more recent article published in 2024 in Science delves into the topic of cellular senescence, examining its role in normal physiological processes. This research highlights the importance of cellular aging and its impact on health and disease, further enriching the scientific discourse surrounding stem cell functionality and longevity. Together, these articles reflect the ongoing exploration of critical biological processes within the realm of SCIENCE, illustrating the journal's commitment to advancing knowledge in biomedicine.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191969, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
