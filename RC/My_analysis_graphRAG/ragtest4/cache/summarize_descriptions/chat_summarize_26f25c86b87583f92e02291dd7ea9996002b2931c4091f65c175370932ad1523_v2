This manipulation affects shear stress and influences various cellular processes, particularly quiescence. In studies involving REF/E23 cells, dextran is utilized in serum starvation media to modulate the depth of quiescence, allowing researchers to assess the effects of varying medium viscosity on cellular responses. By altering the viscosity of the serum-starvation medium, dextran facilitates the investigation of its impact on quiescence and shear stress, making it a valuable tool in biomedical research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192025, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 414, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
