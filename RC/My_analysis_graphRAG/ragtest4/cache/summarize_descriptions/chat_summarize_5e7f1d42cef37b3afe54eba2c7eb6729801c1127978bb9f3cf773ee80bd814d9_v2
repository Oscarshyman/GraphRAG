The first article explores the concept of cell dormancy plasticity, focusing on the transition from quiescence to senescence, which is crucial for understanding cellular aging and its implications in various physiological processes. The second article discusses the mer switch in different physiological contexts, providing insights into the mechanisms that regulate this switch and its relevance to cellular function and adaptation. Together, these articles contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field of physiological genomics, highlighting the intricate relationships between cellular states and their physiological implications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191956, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
