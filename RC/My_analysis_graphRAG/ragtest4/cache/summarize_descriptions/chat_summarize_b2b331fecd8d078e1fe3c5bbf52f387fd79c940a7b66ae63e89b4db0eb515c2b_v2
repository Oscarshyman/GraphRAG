It has been observed that extracellular flow can lead to shallow quiescence, indicating that the flow affects the sensitivity of cells to these signals. Additionally, the depth of quiescence is influenced by extracellular flow, which in turn impacts the cells' capacity to transition out of this dormant state. Thus, the relationship between extracellular flow and quiescence is critical, as it determines both the sensitivity of cells to growth stimuli and their ability to re-enter the active cell cycle.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192072, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 415, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
