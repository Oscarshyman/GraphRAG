EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) incorporation serves as a crucial method for evaluating the capacity of cells that are in a quiescent state to reenter the cell cycle following stimulation. This technique provides insights into the behavior of quiescent cells, highlighting their potential to transition back into active proliferation. By assessing EdU incorporation, researchers can effectively determine the responsiveness of these cells, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the dynamics between quiescence and cell cycle reentry.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192063, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
