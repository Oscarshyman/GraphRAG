Among its notable publications, one article explores the critical role of autophagy in the survival of dormant breast cancer cells, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Another significant article from 2017 discusses the phenomenon of quiescence, revealing that the exit from this dormant state exhibits a memory of previous cell growth and division. Together, these studies contribute to a deeper understanding of cellular behavior in cancer biology, highlighting the complexities of cell survival and proliferation in the context of breast cancer.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192009, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
