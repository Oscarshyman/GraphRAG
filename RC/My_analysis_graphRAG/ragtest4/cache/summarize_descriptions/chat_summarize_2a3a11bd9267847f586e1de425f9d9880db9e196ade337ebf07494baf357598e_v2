This system enables researchers to measure the percentage of cells that have reentered the cell cycle, providing insights into cellular responses under various conditions. Specifically, E2F-GFP is utilized to monitor cell cycle activity in REF/E23 cells and to evaluate the depth of quiescence, as well as the activation of E2F in response to serum stimulation. Overall, E2F-GFP serves as a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of cell cycle progression and the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular activation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191990, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 397, "total_tokens": 547, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
