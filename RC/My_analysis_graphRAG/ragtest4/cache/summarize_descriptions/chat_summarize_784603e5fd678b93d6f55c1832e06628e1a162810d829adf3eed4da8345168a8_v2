It influences how cells enter and maintain this state, effectively regulating the depth of quiescence. Specifically, lysosomal function prevents the deepening of quiescence by reducing oxidative stress, thereby helping to maintain a shallower quiescent state in cells. Additionally, it manages the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, further influencing cellular dormancy. Overall, the interplay between lysosomal function and quiescence is essential for understanding cellular behavior in various biological contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192040, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 453, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
