One notable article discusses how autophagy impairment leads to premature senescence in primary human fibroblasts, highlighting the critical role of autophagy in cellular aging. Another article from the journal examines conserved senescence-associated genes in these fibroblasts, contributing to the understanding of the genetic factors involved in cellular senescence. Additionally, a 2014 publication in PLOS ONE explores the transition of long-term quiescent fibroblast cells into a senescent state, further elucidating the dynamics of fibroblast behavior over time. Furthermore, a 2018 article investigates the effects of fluid shear stress on ovarian cancer cell viability, providing insights into the mechanical influences on cancer cell survival. Collectively, these studies underscore PLOS ONE's commitment to advancing knowledge in the fields of cellular senescence and cancer biology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191947, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 341, "total_tokens": 530, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
