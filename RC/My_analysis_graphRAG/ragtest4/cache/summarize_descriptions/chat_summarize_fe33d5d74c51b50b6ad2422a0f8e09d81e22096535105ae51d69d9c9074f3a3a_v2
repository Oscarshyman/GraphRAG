REF/E23 cells are specifically employed to investigate the mechanisms underlying quiescence, a state in which cells are metabolically inactive but can re-enter the cell cycle under certain conditions. These cells are particularly valuable for examining how quiescent states are influenced by various external factors, including serum and extracellular flow. By utilizing REF/E23 cells, researchers can gain insights into the responses of quiescent cells to these stimuli, thereby enhancing the understanding of cellular dynamics in both normal and pathological conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192072, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
