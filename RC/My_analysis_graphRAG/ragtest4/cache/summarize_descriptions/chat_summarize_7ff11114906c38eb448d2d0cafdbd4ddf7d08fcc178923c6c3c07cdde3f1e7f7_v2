This signature comprises genes that not only indicate the presence of cellular senescence but also display expression patterns akin to those observed in deep quiescence. Furthermore, the changes in expression of these senescence core signature genes are closely associated with the process of cellular senescence, highlighting a significant molecular link between the two. This relationship underscores the importance of the senescence core signature in understanding the mechanisms and implications of cellular senescence in various biological contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192050, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
