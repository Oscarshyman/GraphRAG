This alteration in viscosity has a direct effect on the quiescence depth of cells, a state of dormancy that cells can enter under certain conditions. Specifically, increasing the medium's viscosity with dextran can facilitate the exit from quiescence when cells are subjected to flow conditions. This demonstrates dextran's critical role in modulating cellular behavior, particularly in how cells transition between quiescent and active states in response to changes in their environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192074, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 396, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
