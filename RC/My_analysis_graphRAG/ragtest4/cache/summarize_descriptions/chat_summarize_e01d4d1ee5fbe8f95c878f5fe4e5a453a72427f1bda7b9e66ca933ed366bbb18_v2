Martin-Villalba is a researcher recognized for his significant contributions to the understanding of neural stem cells. His work encompasses the study of dormant neural stem cells, focusing on their characteristics and potential roles in the brain. Additionally, he has investigated the activation of these stem cells in response to brain injury, exploring how they may contribute to repair mechanisms following neurological damage. Through his research, Martin-Villalba has provided valuable insights into the behavior of neural stem cells, which could have implications for therapeutic strategies in neuroregeneration and brain health.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191969, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 284, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
