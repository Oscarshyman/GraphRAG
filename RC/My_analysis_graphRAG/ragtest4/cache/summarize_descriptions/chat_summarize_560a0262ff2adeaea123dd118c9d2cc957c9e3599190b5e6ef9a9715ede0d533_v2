Notably, one article from 2021 delves into the histone code associated with cellular quiescence, providing insights into the epigenetic regulation of this state. Additionally, multiple articles published in February 2022 explore the effects of extracellular flow and fluid dynamics on cellular quiescence, highlighting how these physical factors influence the behavior and state of cells. Collectively, these publications contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing cellular quiescence and the role of extracellular environments in modulating cellular states.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191960, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 526, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
