This process affects the cells' ability to proliferate and alters their metabolic states. Specifically, serum starvation leads to quiescence in various cell types, including REF/E23 cells, and is utilized as a method to study the conditions required for reactivation. Under serum starvation, these cells remain in a state of dormancy until they receive specific stimuli to reenter the cell cycle, highlighting the intricate relationship between serum availability and cellular activity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192045, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 483, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
