Notably, it has featured multiple research articles that explore the behavior and characteristics of neural stem cells. One article discusses dormant neural stem cells that become activated following brain injury, highlighting the potential for these cells to contribute to brain repair mechanisms. This topic was also addressed in a 2015 publication, which similarly focused on the activation of dormant neural stem cells in response to brain injury. Additionally, a 2019 article delves into the concept of stem cell quiescence, examining the dynamics of these cells in their inactive state. Collectively, these articles underscore the critical role of neural stem cells in regenerative processes and the intricate mechanisms governing their activation and quiescence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191953, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 462, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
