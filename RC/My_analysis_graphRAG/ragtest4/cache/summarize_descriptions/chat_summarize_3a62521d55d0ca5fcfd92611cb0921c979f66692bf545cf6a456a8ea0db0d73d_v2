These cells are primarily utilized in research to investigate cellular quiescence and the various responses of cells to different stimuli. REF/E23 cells can be induced to enter a quiescent state through serum starvation, and they can be stimulated to reenter the cell cycle upon the addition of serum. Additionally, they are employed to study the effects of extracellular factors and fluid flow on cellular behavior, particularly in microfluidic environments. Notably, REF/E23 cells feature a stably integrated E2f1 promoter-driven destabilized GFP reporter, which aids in the observation of cellular processes and responses during experiments. Overall, REF/E23 cells serve as a valuable tool for understanding the mechanisms of quiescence and the influence of external factors on cell dynamics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192025, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 449, "total_tokens": 623, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
