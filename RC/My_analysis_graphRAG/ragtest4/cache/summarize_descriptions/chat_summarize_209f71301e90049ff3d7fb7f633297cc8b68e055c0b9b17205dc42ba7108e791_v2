Notably, it includes a study that investigates the alignment of fibroblasts under the influence of interstitial fluid flow, highlighting the cellular responses to mechanical stimuli in the heart and circulatory system. Additionally, a 2005 article published in the same journal explores the effects of fluid shear stress on Flk-1-positive embryonic stem cells, demonstrating how this mechanical force can induce their differentiation into vascular endothelial cells in vitro. Together, these studies underscore the journal's commitment to advancing the understanding of cellular behavior in response to biomechanical factors within the cardiovascular context.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192032, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 464, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
