This mass can increase in response to various stimuli, including serum starvation, and is particularly notable as cells enter deeper states of quiescence. The increase in lysosomal mass during these conditions is associated with changes in lysosomal function and autophagy processes. Overall, lysosomal mass serves as an important indicator of cellular health and metabolic state, reflecting the cell's adaptive responses to environmental challenges.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742191979, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_3267753c5d", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 362, "total_tokens": 466, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
