Serum-starvation medium is utilized to induce a state of quiescence in these cells by depriving them of essential growth factors. This medium plays a crucial role in limiting the availability of growth factors, which is fundamental for triggering the quiescent state in various cell types. Thus, serum-starvation medium is essential for effectively inducing quiescence, highlighting its importance in experimental settings aimed at understanding cellular behavior under nutrient-deprived conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1742192065, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_06737a9306", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in biomedical informatics.
